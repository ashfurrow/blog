It's with a mix of emotions that I'm announcing that today is my final day working for [Float](https://floatfinancial.com/). I've accomplished a lot at Float and I'm grateful for the opportunity to help shape such a young company and product team. I'm sad to say goodbye to my coworkers and I wish everyone the best.

I always learn a lot from any job – that's just how I practice product development – but I was surprised by how much I learned _about myself_ at Float. I've worked in early-stage startups before and so I _thought_ I had an idea of what to expect. There were two curve balls I didn't anticipate.

The first is Float's unique and unreproducible advantage: _everyone_ at the company cares about Float's success. They work harder to earn the customers' business, to fight for their market position. My 2023 job search's goal was to find a place where I could do my best work, and so a company full of people who cared deeply about _their_ work was a perfect fit for me. There is, however, an intensity that comes with that environment. Float is the most ferocious company I have ever worked for, and I'm proud of how I rose to that challenge.

The other difference is me. _I'm_ different. At other startups I've joined, my role was (at first) to build apps. I grew into leadership positions, but Float was my first time I _joined_ an early company _as a leader_. That brought a whole new set of challenges. I worked more closely with company leadership, I got insight into the business that I hadn't had access to at other startups, and I exercised my autonomy appropriately. That's a lot of extra context to absorb and execute on.

I'm proud of my accomplishments here, as both a technical leader and as an organizational leader. Building an app from scratch is always a lot of fun, and the team I led launched the app only 99 days after our initial commit. Scaling a mobile app within a product organization is always an interesting challenge, and I leave the Float mobile app with over a dozen contributors, across _every_ product team. Being part of a high-growth engineering team is always thrilling, and I've successfully modelled my practice of product development through curiousity and empathy. I'm proud of what I've accomplished here.

Failure has always been my greatest teacher. Float is a company where you cannot succeed without taking risks and making mistakes, and I've been successful enough to have made some of my most interesting mistakes. I'm proud of these mistakes. I treasure them.

Deciding to leave a company is never easy for me, and particularly so with Float. It's a special company and I'm sure it'll continue to make waves. I wish Float and my coworkers well.

I keep a small box of what I call "captain's trinkets." Picard had his flute, Sisko had his baseball, and Freeman had her California Republic flag. In my office, I keep a small collection of objects that symbolize meaningful times of my life. Float's first product was in corporate credit cards so I feel it's appropriate to retire my own Float card to the captain's trinkets box.

I have an exciting new opportunity that I'm pursuing after some time off. When I've described the role to people who've known me, they've nodded and said something like "oh yeah, that's perfect for you." I'm excited to share more. Until then, take care!
