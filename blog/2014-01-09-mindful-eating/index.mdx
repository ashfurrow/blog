Neuroscientist Sandra Aamodt has a great TED talk on dieting and eating.

> Doctors don't know of any approach that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people. ... Even at its best, dieting is a waste of time and energy.

The crux of it is that dieting doesn't work, and there's not much you can do to change your weight. The best approach is "mindful eating", eating when you're hungry and stopping when you're full.

_Turns out_.

It's a great way to spend 12 minutes.
