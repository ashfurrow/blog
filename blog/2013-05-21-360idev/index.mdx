I'll be giving a talk in September at [360iDev](http://360idev.com) about how to effectively use open source software.

Use of open source code is quite common, but the tools don't support or encourage developers to use it – I'm looking at you, Xcode. I'm going to be presenting some different techniques to avoid the pitfalls of using open source software when developing OS X and iOS apps.

If you're attending 360iDev, I'd love to meet you. If you're not attending, I'd encourage you to do so. It's going to be a lot of fun.
