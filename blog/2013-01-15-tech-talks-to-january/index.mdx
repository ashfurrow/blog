I'll be giving a talk next Tuesday evening at [Tech Talks TO](http://techtalksto.com/post/40607791416/ash-furrow-presenting-accessibility-and-unit-testing).

The topic is going to be vitamins as a metaphor for Unit Testing and Accessibility in a maturing iOS ecosystem. These are two topics I've taken on lately in iOS development, and I'm really interested in sharing what I've learnt so far.

It's going to be an interesting one, for sure!
