Since its announcement, I've been a skeptic of the Apple Watch. However, except for some reactions from the initial watch event, I stopped talking publicly about it. Not because I thought I was wrong, but because talking shit about the watch would serve no point.

One of two things could – and still can – happen:

1. The Apple Watch flops, a scenario where my skepticism would've been astute, but a scenario that would've hurt Apple (and, indirectly, the entire iOS software industry).
1. The Apple watch succeeds, in which case I was wrong, but everyone is happy, so why would I want to rain on anyone's parade? 

I got an Apple Watch through Apple's iOS developer-watch-purchase-lottery. Orta said it would be good to have an Artsy development device, and to be honest, I'm not comfortable writing software for a platform that I've never experienced as a user. 

Well, it's been a week since I put it on and – despite my skepticism – I've been actively trying to use it. So I'm going to give what I consider to be high praise. 

Apple Watch: not as useless as I thought. 

It's true! I swear that's not facetious! I thought the watch would be quite silly – a device for "people who own iPhones but don't like using their iPhones", I joked to myself. 

But that description turned out to be pretty accurate. _Turns out_, I _don't_ like using my phone. Or, at least, I didn't appreciate the opportunity cost of using it so much. 

The watch's interface follows a different paradigm – on the surface, of course, but much more fundamental than that. To me, my phone has always been a sort of push/pull system. I can get notified of things (push), or I can go get things to read/do (pull). The watch is meant to be push-only: you get notifications and your interactions with the watch are mostly meant to be reactions to those notifications. 

It has surprised me just how many pull-based interactions I was having with my phone just because it had interrupted me with a push-based one. I would get a notification, respond to an iMessage, then head over to check Twitter while I had my phone out. Then Flipboard. Then email. Then Facebook. 

Ugh. 

The trade-off with the watch is that I don't spend as much time looking at my phone, which [I kind of like](http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/06/the-apple-watch-is-time-saved/#.qd8j7d:VAdI). 

In the end, I think I was right about there not being a compelling reason to buy the watch. It is a nice-to-have. No one benefits _that much_ from a watch the same way that I would argue people benefit _a tonne_ from having an iPhone or an iPad. But what I failed to understand at the time of the announcement was that that was OK. 

Instead of one, compelling _raison d'être_ for the watch, it looks like Apple's goal is to make my life better by keeping me off my phone. 

Huh.
