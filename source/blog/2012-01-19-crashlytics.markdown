As the sole iOS Developer at 500px, I have to stay on top of everything with regards to the app: requesting design assets from Adam, fixing bugs, providing support to users, and developing new features. I leverage a few third-party tools (like&nbsp; [TestFlight](http://testflightapp.com)) to make my job easier. However, [Crashlytics](http://www.crashlytics.com/)&nbsp;beats them all. Combined. It is second only to Xcode in terms of how important it is to creating iOS apps.

As I recently talked about, we had some [crashing issues with the 500px iPad app](/blog/walk-dont-run-a-cautionary-tale-of-ios-app-store-approval/)&nbsp;that I had to fix. The stable version, 1.3.3, is now live. It is only as stable as it is because Crashyltics was so helpful in determining where the app was crashing and why. It is super easy to use; it's hard to remember how I maintained apps without it.

Currently, [their "buzz" page](http://beta.crashlytics.com/buzz/) lists testimonials from their users.

Let me make this easy for you: you need to go sign up for this. Your app _is crashing right now_&nbsp;and you probably don't even know about it.
