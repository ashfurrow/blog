title: "Depressive Funk"

I've been under considerable stress lately. The [move](http://ashfurrow.com/blog/moving-to-amsterdam) has certainly been the key factor, but I've also bitten off a bit more than I can chew in personal projects (and I've got a "hard out" at work – a deadline of Friday that is unmovable due to the fact that I'm leaving T+L).

I've felt myself slipping back into a depressive funk, and I don't like it.

To make matters worse, yesterday I forgot to take my medication. Funny how everything was fine until late yesterday afternoon, when I realized my mistake, I started to feel jittery, dizzy, and unable to focus. I almost wish that it had gone unnoticed. Instead, I'm dealing with the fallout of that today. It's hard to describe what it's like to be on antidepressants, and to forget to take them. It's not fun.

This time, however, I have something to help me besides medication. I've been reading a book called [Mind Over Mood](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0898621283/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0898621283&linkCode=as2&tag=ashfur-20) that discusses strategies for self-talk and cognitive-behavioural therapy-style thought modification that's been really helpful. If you've been struggling with depression, I highly recommend it.

In any case, I'm trying to stay positive. Only a few more days until I'm in freaking Amsterdam! It's hard, but I'm trying to be more excited than nervous.
