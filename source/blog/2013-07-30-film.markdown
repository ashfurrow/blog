I've been getting into film photography lately after using only digital for my entire stint as a hobby photographer.

I'm really enjoying film. The process of it. Contemplating the shot and double, triple checking my composition. Having to wait for the film to be developed. It's quaint but majestic in a way. I feel like when I take a digital image, I'm taking it to share with others, but when I take a film photograph, I'm taking it to keep for myself. I'm trying to bring that feeling over to my digital photography, too.

This weekend, I'm travelling back home to New Brunswick. I'll be taking my film SLR as well as my (new) DSLR and I plan to use them both. I'll let you know how the shots turn out.
