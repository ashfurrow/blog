If you _ever_ author a blog post with your own name in the title, make _damn sure_ that it's a good one. People [googling your name](http://www.google.ca/search?q=Ash+Furrow) will have it show up first in their search results which, in my case, leads to one of the [most popular posts on my old blog](http://atteroignorantiam.blogspot.com/2010/07/ash-furrow-kijiji-impersonator.html).
