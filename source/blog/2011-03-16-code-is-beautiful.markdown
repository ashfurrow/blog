A [classmate of mine](http://twitter.com/#!/nanoinfinity) wrote an interesting blog post yesterday about how [Code is Beautiful](http://philenotfound.blogspot.com/2011/03/code-is-beautiful.html).

> Code is poetry. It's creativity. Code tells a story, and a very complex one at that. Coding is a creative problem solving exercise. A finished program both describes and solves a problem

This is something I've [discussed before](http://blogs.unb.ca/ash-furrow/2010/12/13/programming-as-art/). I think programming can be artful and I use it as a creative outlet. Furthermore, it encourages use of a semicolon in everyday writing, my favourite punctuation symbol; you should all use them, too.
