In case you haven't already seen it, [Skeu It!](http://skeu.it) is a delightful new Tumblr dedicated to showcasing skeumorphism gone wrong. Readers submit screenshots of apps and the author provides some pretty funny feedback.

Today, he released an [FAQ](http://skeu.it/post/31463162523/faq), which, in part, read as follows.

> Just yesterday, two indie devs submitted their own work with their own captions. Humility is a beneficial trait. As someone who routinely presents work that doesn’t get the response I had hoped, I can assure you laughing about it is pretty fun. ![](/img/import/blog/skeu-it/1CDD0F5D25B3492A876BF7172C4FAE82.jpg)

I was actually one of those indie devs; I submitted [Photo Hour](http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/photo-hour/id524263013?mt=8), an app I wrote to tell you the best time of the day to take photos. I made it look and feel like an SLR camera, and I wasn't expecting to get serious feedback.

Just Maxwell responded with some great feedback that I'm looking forward to incorporating into a future release. He said that my use of skeuomorphism was appropriate for my audience, and I think that is the real issue with all these nerds who are hating on skeu.

Skeuomorphism isn't _inherently bad_, but it has a place. Skeu It! is a reminder of how slapping linen on everything isn't good design, but linen in a design isn't necessarily bad design, either.
