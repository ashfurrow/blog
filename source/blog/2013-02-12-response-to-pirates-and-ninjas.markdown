Igor Elland has a [good response](http://igor.elland.me/post/42939258554/pirate-versus-ninja) to my [Pirates and Ninjas](/blog/pirates-and-ninjas) article. The argument is that not only is a pirate life not a fit for me, but it's not a fit for anyone.

> Sure we have the billion dollar valuation here and there, but that’s the lottery mentality taking over your good sense. Don’t let it.

When I said that the pirate's life was not for me, I didn't only mean the 70+ hour work weeks. I meant that my motivation for making things isn't based on the valuation for the company. I feel compelled to make amazing things. _That_ is what motivates me. And even at awesome startups, that's not what motivates the founders.
