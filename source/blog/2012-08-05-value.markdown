I have always struggled with a certain about of consumerism and a fixation with acquiring new stuff. Growing up, it was toys, then gadgets, then grown-up toys. I've spent a lot of money on things I didn't need, or that I wanted, but grew bored with quickly. Even today, I struggle with the appeal of novelty. 



Recently, I've suffered a loss of some people I was close to; I went from seeing my friends almost every day to seeing them once every few weeks, and that's been hard. It's lead to a lot of reflection for me, and I've come to a conclusion.

The most valuable thing I have is the group of people I've chosen to spend my time with. The smartest investment I've made is the decision to spend time with them.

I feel like I just blinked and a year went by. And in that year, I've spent lots of money on things I don't remember, but all the experiences I've had with people have profoundly enriched me in ways I still don't completely appreciate.
