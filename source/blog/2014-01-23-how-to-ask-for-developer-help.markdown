I've written four books and dozens of tutorials and sample code projects, so I get a bit of questions from readers over email. I love hearing from people and getting questions, and I make it very easy to get in touch with me.

Often, people have a question about something technical. Most developers are more than happy to help if they can, but one-to-one help doesn't scale well. Chances are if one person has a question, someone else has it too. If the conversation stays in email, then others can't benefit from the answer.

Instead, I recommend posting a question to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com), listing [what you've tried](http://mattgemmell.com/what-have-you-tried/) so far and any applicable sample code. The more information you provide, the easier it is for the community to help you.

Open source your question so they can open source the answer.
