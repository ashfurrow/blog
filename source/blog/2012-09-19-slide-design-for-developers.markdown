As I worry about my approaching [FITC presentation](http://www.fitc.ca/events/presentations/presentation.cfm?event=134&presentation_id=2044), I'm pretty ecstatic to have Adam working on the slides for the presentation. A real designer - this presentation is really going to stand out.

Nevertheless, I found [Holman's guide to Slide Design](http://zachholman.com/posts/slide-design-for-developers/) to be very helpful in terms of _presentation design_.

> The best jazz soloists are capable of starting a melody, repeating it, and then playing with it after the audience has identified with the repetition. The best storytellers will repeat the same line throughout a story to build a sense of familiarity, of excitement.

I'm actually accomplished as at saxophone jazz improvisation. This might not be so hard after all :)
