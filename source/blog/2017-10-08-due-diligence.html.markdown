Okay so yesterday I wrote a [hypothetical blog post](/blog/apple-releases-jive/) about a new testing framework that Apple made. I've got a lot of feedback – more than I expected, honestly. Developers really care about their tools.

One piece of criticism I received is that I hadn't filed any bug reports with Apple asking for these features. I did include a link to [Apple's bug reporter](http://bugreport.apple.com) and asked people to file radars, but I didn't provide any radars to duplicate. That was an oversight on my part.

So here's some due diligence: I have filed eleven radars with Apple asking for individual features that would each enhance the developer experience. They have all been cross-posted to [Open Radar](http://www.openradar.me/), so please feel free to duplicate them.

- [34876469	Isolate global state between tests by isolating tests](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5001137547640832)

These are _all_ feature requests that I'm bringing from other communities – mainly Ruby and JavaScript. I've been [asking developers to bring ideas from other communities since Swift was in beta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtrzZb5Jw0g). It's fair to ask me to follow my own advice.

What features would make your day-to-day life as a developer easier, or more joyful?
