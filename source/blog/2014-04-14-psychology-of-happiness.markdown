I just watched a [really interesting](http://www.ted.com/talks/shawn_achor_the_happy_secret_to_better_work) TED Talk on happiness. In it, the speaker (who is pretty hilarious) talks about goalpost moving. For example, we think that we'll be happy when we achieve X, but then we do achieve X and then we think we'll be happy when we achieve X+1. This is a concept that I've [written about before](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/you-never-arrive).

Instead, we need to turn things around and take a look at what makes us happy _now_. I highly recommend you watch through the video and take a look for yourself.
