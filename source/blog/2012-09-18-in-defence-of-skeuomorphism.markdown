Eric Portelance [tweeted this morning](https://twitter.com/eportelance/status/248069041254715393) a fascinating interview with a former Apple designer who [defends Apple's recent uses of skeuomorphism](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670796/a-former-iphone-ui-designer-defends-apples-fake-leather-design-philosophy).

> A leather texture, for example, definitely creates a certain environment and state of mind when you’re using it. I don’t think there is right and wrong, or good and bad here.

Exactly. Like anything in design, there is [tasteful use of skeuomorphism](https://ashfurrow.com/skeu-it) and then there is [going too far](http://skeu.it). Too much of anything can be bad.

Apple has arguably optimized for the first-time user experience of their apps, but their use of skeuomorphism has a purpose. I think many nerds who are upset about skeuomorphism aren't taking that purpose into account.
