I just got an interesting form email from the CEO of [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com), which read, in part, as follows.

> In recent weeks, Twitter announced policy changes\* that will affect how applications and users like yourself can interact with Twitter's data. As a result of these changes, on September 27th we will be removing all Twitter Triggers, disabling your ability to push tweets to places like email, Evernote and Facebook.
> 
> \*These Twitter policy changes specifically disallow uploading Twitter Content to a "cloud based service" (Section 4A [https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms](https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms)) and include stricter enforcement of the Developer Display Requirements ( [https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements](https://dev.twitter.com/terms/display-requirements)).

IFTTT is a fantastic service that basically allows you to connect any online service to any another with what they call "receipes." Lately, recipes for taking _your_ tweets and sending a copy of them to [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/global/) have sprung up.

Twitter is likely taking this action against IFTTT to prevent users from sending their own tweets to this service, which is kind of a dick move, but one I've been expecting since I saw the first ADN recipe.

It's certainly the kind of move we've come to expect from Twitter.

_Golf clap_.
