There is a saying among photojournalists that's called "f/8 and be there" that I discussed with a coworker earlier today. The expression means that the most important part of photojournalism is to capture clear photos and be somewhere where and when photos need to be captured.

As a photographer, I like to think of it as also "fate and be there" (if you kind of slur "eff eight"). I think of the phrase as embodying what it is to be a photographer: part fate, and part effort.

Good photography is [rarely convenient](http://www.vibrantshot.com/great-shots-arent-convenient/), so you definitely have to have the gear and the drive to be there at the right moment to get the capture.

I left at six in the morning to capture [Peggy's Cove](http://500px.com/photo/21789803). However, when I took that shot, it was terribly overcast and the capture was not the picture I wanted to take. That's the fate part: if I had come a day earlier, the photo would have been much more beautiful.

I'm continuing to explore photography as a hobby, and I'm very interested in how it's affecting my life as a software developer.
