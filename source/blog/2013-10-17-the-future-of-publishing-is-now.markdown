[Interesting article](http://www.robertnewman.com/the-future-of-publishing-is-now/) I read this morning about the future of publishing and publishers.

I've said it before and I'll say it again now: the needs and desires of traditional media outlets are not congruent or compatible with the needs and desires of individuals or small teams working to publish something. Yesterday, [I became a publisher](/blog/35mm-launch), and this has dramatically changed the way that I read articles like this one.

One thing that stood out to me as incredible obvious, but apparently needed to be said, is that your readers are a community and you should engage with them. Our editor, designer, and myself have been active in accruing participation from our audience.
