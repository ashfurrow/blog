Yesterday, the iOS team at 500px revealed [500px for iPhone](http://500px.com/iPhone), and we couldn't be prouder of it.

This app has been in the works since we originally released the iPad app a year ago. We've been refining the design for months and iterating on prototypes, throwing away whatever didn't work. In the process, Paddy and I got really good at writing this kind of app.

The total duration of this final iteration took 6 weeks of long hours. It wasn't easy, but we're proud of our work. The reward was definitely worth it.

Mark Shannon has a [terrific review of our app](http://mkshft.ca/blog/archives/an-in-depth-look-500px-com-has-a-beautiful-new-iphone-app) that highlights some of the details we put extra effort into.

We also had the opportunity to do a Google Hangout and answer questions about the app. Everything from support questions, design considerations, implementation details, and future plans was discussed. It was great to get in front of our community and show off what we had worked on. I love it when users contact me directly, and for the first time, I was able to contact them.

I love working at a place where the best interests of our users are our best interests. We aren't trying to make our site appealing to advertisers; we don't have ads. We make an awesome product and people pay us for it. We make it better so more people will pay. It's awesome.
