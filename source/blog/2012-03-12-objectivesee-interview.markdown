As part of an ongoing series of interviews with Objective-C developers, [ObjectiveSee](http://www.objectivesee.com/) is [featuring me](http://www.objectivesee.com/ash.furrow.html) this week. 



I'm pretty excited to be included on a page with the likes of Jim Dovey, Milen Dzhumerov, and Oliver Drobnik, as well as other notable Objective-C developers.
