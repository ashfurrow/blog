I've launched a new podcast: [Springboard](http://springboardshow.com). It's a show for newcomers to iOS software development.

My inaugural guest is [Matthew Bischoff](http://twitter.com/mb). We had a great conversation about getting started with your first app, some awesome tips and tricks, and how to get featured by the App Store. Definitely [subscribe](http://springboardshow.com/?format=rss) and [give it a listen](http://springboardshow.com/episodes/1).
