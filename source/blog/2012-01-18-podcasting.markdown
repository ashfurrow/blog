<p>Why on Earth did it take me so long to get into podcasting? Obviously I'm not shy about putting my opinions on the Internet and don't care if no one reads them, so it's not that.<!--more-->
Podcasting requires arcane knowledge (particularly, sounds engineering); it ostensibly needs high-end, expensive equipment; it takes a kind of craft and dedication to that craft to make it worthwhile at all; finally, you find yourself immersed in a subculture obsessed with these aspects of podcasting. It is everything I love about coffee, but for podcasting.</p>

<p>The only thing missing, I believe, is knowledge about the craft itself. Once I learned that coffee can taste, you know, good, I was all over it! Once I started listening to podcasts on my own, I realized <em>I</em> could do it, too. What other things out there are just waiting to eat up all my free time?</p>
