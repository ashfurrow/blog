<import><p>Recently, I developed two open source UIKit controls you can easily use in your apps. They are called <a href="https://github.com/TeehanLax/TLTiltHighlightView">TLTiltHighlightView</a> and <a href="https://github.com/TeehanLax/TLTiltSlider">TLTiltSlider</a>. I call them "tilt" becuase they adjust their appearance depending on how you hold your device. </p>

It's a bar they set that we should all try and surpass.  </p></import>
