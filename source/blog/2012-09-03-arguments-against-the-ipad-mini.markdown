I’ve written plenty of 1500-2000 word pieces on my iPad (including this one), and have seen plenty of people in coffee shops typing quite well that way.> The Nexus 7's landscape keyboard feels firmly planted in the "prohibitive to use" end of the ballpark. It’s just too thin. Again, I have a hard time believing a keyboard on an iPad mini will fare much better.

It's refreshing to finally see someone else stand up against a wave of Apple rumour mongerers who _insist_ the iPad Mini is a fact. It's not a fact and I don't think it will exist.

There are some valid reasons to want a smaller iPad - John Siracusa has detailed them on a [recent episode](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/83) of Hypercritical.

Just because we _want_ something doesn't mean Apple will make it. Just because Apple _can_ make something with their existing supply chain doesn't mean they will. Just because everything _conincidentally_ works out with [DPI](http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=25102) doesn't make it real.

I don't want Apple to release an iPad Mini because I think it would be a bad business decision. Then again, just because I don't think they should doesn't mean they won't.
