(I'll try not to get too meta, here.)

In case you haven't noticed, I'm taking this blog a lot more seriously lately. I'm writing more frequently and with more focused, developer-oriented articles. I thought I'd compare July and August to the same time frame in 2011, before I started at 500px.

This isn't the astronomical increase it appears to be, since Google analytics doesn't treat the horizontal axis as zero.

Still! It's nice to know on my worst day _now_, I'm getting more viewers than on my best day of the previous year. Onwards and upwards!

If you ever have suggestions for improvements or articles you'd like me to write, please [get in touch](http://ashfurrow.com/about/).
