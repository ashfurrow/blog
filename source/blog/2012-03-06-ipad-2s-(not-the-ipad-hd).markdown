<p>There's a big Apple event tomorrow to announce the new iPad. From the <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/03/04/ipad-3-parts-put-together-on-video-ipad-2-smart-cover-still-works/" target="_blank">rumours</a>, it'll be almost identical to the iPad 2 except with a "retina" display and possibly a better camera. Which is why I believe that it will be announced as the "iPad 2S"<!--more-->
Apple has two types of product announcements: revolutionary, and evolutionary. Revolutionary products really shake things up; they are either all new products or vastly improved versions of older productions. Evolutionary products, on the other hand, are small, incremental improvements on existing offerings.</p>

<p>Apple has an established naming convention when it comes to evolutionary iOS products: it's the old product name, followed by an S. iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4S are the two examples. These featured only modest improvements in specs, though they <em>did</em> have some of their own features (like Siri or the 3GS' compass).</p>

<p>The new iPad is going to have almost <em>identical</em> specs to the iPad 2, just with a new display. Yes, it is a big, important feature, but it's only one feature. Siri is a huge feature - the ability to literally speak with your phone - but it only earned the iPhone 4S status as an "evolutionary" product.</p>

<p>The iPad 2S will include a retina display and new graphics hardware to support the screen. Maybe a better camera. Literally <em>everything</em> else about the product will be identical from a consumer's perspective.</p>

<p>I'm not going to justify the "iPad 2S" name anymore - everyone else can justify the "iPad 3" name.</p>

<p><small>(As for "iPad HD", please. That's so crass - this is Apple, not Samsung.)</small></p>
