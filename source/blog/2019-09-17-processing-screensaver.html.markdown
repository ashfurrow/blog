[In my last post](/blog/my-first-xoxo-impressions-thoughts-feels/), I briefly noted that I had some ideas I've wanted to implement [from Processing](https://p5js.org). Making things has been an itch that I've ignored for too long, and this weekend I made some success.

This summer, I was lucky to visit [The Whitney Museum's _Programmed_ show](https://whitney.org/exhibitions/programmed), which established "connections between works of art based on instructions, spanning over fifty years of conceptual, video, and computational art." I really enjoyed the show, especially [this one artwork by Casey Reas](https://whitney.org/exhibitions/software-structures), implemented in Processing. I loved the implied interplay between moving circles, and I wanted it. I wanted it in my life.

> A surface filled with one hundred medium to small sized circles. Each circle has a different size and direction, but moves at the same slow rate. 
> Display: 
>
> A. The instantaneous intersections of the circles 
>
> B. The aggregate intersections of the circles 

So over the weekend, I [found an implementation in p5.js](https://artport.whitney.org/commissions/softwarestructures2016/s3_1/). And then I [created a static site](https://github.com/ashfurrow/screensaver) deployed through Netlify to [screensaver.ashfurrow.com](https://screensaver.ashfurrow.com). Finally, I found an [open source macOS screensaver](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver) that you can point to an arbitrary URL to show for your screensaver. Perfect.

Today I was in a meeting and my screensaver turned on. I'd forgotten about it. And I was so happy to see it.

(Please don't judge my dirty screen.)

So I didn't really do much, beyond customizing some colours, but now I have a really cool screensaver. I made something, out of existing pieces. It feels good, and I want to make more things.
