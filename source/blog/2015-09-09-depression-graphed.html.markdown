A while ago, I cam across a two-part series of drawings which discussed depression ([Part I](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.nl/2011/10/adventures-in-depression.html) & [Part II](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.nl/2013/05/depression-part-two.html)). I related to a lot of the themes Allie Brosh depicted from her own struggles with depression. I got really excited when I found [her book](http://amzn.to/1McmNmt).

It's amazing how simple drawings can relate such a broad range of feelings. Words often get in the way of communicating, especially about something as personal and subjective as depression. 

Over the past few months of therapy, I've gained a better picture of my own depression, and I want to record these insights. Maybe someone else will find them useful or informative, but mainly this post is so I can understand myself better.

I was pretty low earlier this year, due to a bunch of problems that seemed to gang up on me all at once. Concerned, my wife made me an appointment with a therapist late in May. This would be the first talk therapy I'd have done since 2010.

Things started to improve. Slowly, but noticeably. 

A few weeks ago, I decided to record my sustained progress somewhere – in case I ever needed proof that things _can_ improve. Things like that can really help when I feel hopeless. This is kind of like a quantified self(-esteem). I can't manage what I don't measure.

Before going to bed, I'd record how my day went on a calendar. Good days got smily faces and bad days got frowny ones. There's a lot you can express in a smily face, so I could convey subtlety.

My calendar got thinking about graphing depression, and how it's not nearly as straight-forward as I thought. 

----------------

So after a few weeks of therapy, things were looking pretty good. I was doing a lot better – my mood had improved a tonne.

Then I kept getting better. Things kept improving, my mood got more stable, I started socializing with friends again – an overall improvement.

Super cool, eh? 

The thing is, this really put my initial improvement in perspective.

A few things came to mind. First, the original improvement felt _a lot_ smaller. Even though it was difficult and even though it took a lot of effort, somehow that initial upswing just didn't seem as significant. It made me a bit sad, but then I realized that this sadness was irrational (recognizing and dismissing irrational, automatic thoughts has been an important part of my treatment).

Second, it made me realize that as good as I feel _now_, I still have a long ways to go. To be honest, I feel a bit intimidated. But I recognize that any progress is difficult, and getting as far as I have is proof that I can keep going. 

----------------

But there's a problem. Those graphs are all lies. They aren't incorrect, just incomplete. 

My calendar conveyed a lot of subtlety, which a dinky little line that goes mostly in the "up" direction just can't do. In reality, things go up and down _all the time_, and (hopefully) the average baseline trends upwards.

Somedays go really well, and some days I find myself feeling just like I did before I started therapy. My baseline – my homeostatic mood – has been improving, but there are still really bad days. 

_Even this graph_ is an oversimplification. The problem stems from the idea that the vertical axis reflects an absolute measurement of "mood" – it implies that my mood can be categorized as either "good" or "bad", or somewhere between the two. 

![Vertical axis is a lie](/img/blog/depression-graphed/graph5.png)

But that's not really the case. A person's mood is not reducible to a number line – moods are made up of a variety of feelings, all experienced at the same time. 

![What makes up a person's mood](/img/blog/depression-graphed/graph6.png)

I've learnt that depression isn't a spike in sadness or a dip in happiness. Depression is an utter absence of feelings. It is flatness. An inability to feel anything. 

![Depression, graphed](/img/blog/depression-graphed/graph7.png)

I'm not sure that depression can be graphed to the same level of accuracy as heart rate or blood pressure. It's something that is wildly unpredictable. _Sometimes_. Often I can see a depressive episode on the horizon. But sometimes they hit me from come out of the blue.

In [Part II](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.nl/2013/05/depression-part-two.html) of her discussion on depression, Allie Brosh explains that the first feeling to return to her was [hatred](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JRfSp-ALu3Q/Uga2ko-8r0I/AAAAAAAAKKo/dxhhBX89w0E/s1600/ADTWO39.png). 

> But hatred is technically a feeling, and my brain latched onto it like a child learning a new word.

> [Brain throwing hate]: "I HATE SUN! I HATE PURPLE! I HATE ME!"

This last weekend – Labour Day weekend – was very flat for me. I spent most of my long weekend staring at the ceiling, sometimes a wall. I threw myself at some [work on my website](http://ashfurrow.com/blog/blog-infrastructure/) as a distraction, but it didn't really help. 

I'm bouncing back, but it's slow. Last night on my way from work, _all_ I could feel was anger. This morning on my way to work, I yelled at a taxi driver who had cut me off. He looked scared, like he was afraid I was going to open his car door and hurt him. I didn't like that. I don't want to be someone that people are afraid of.

There's no takeaway here, no lesson learned or advice to give. I'm figuring this out as I go along, but I'm fortunate enough to have a family that loves me, a supportive work environment, and access to professional help. 

I think I'll keep focusing on the good feelings, on trying to get a smily face on my calendar at the end of the day.
