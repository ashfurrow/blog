[Whoa](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/09/24iPhone-5-First-Weekend-Sales-Top-Five-Million.html).

If you're interested in seeing some serious nerd angst, look at the [Slashdot Article Comments](http://apple.slashdot.org/story/12/09/23/0036246/ios-6-adoption-tops-25-after-just-48-hours) discussing how comparing Android OS adoption numbers to iOS adoption numbers is _totally not cool, man_.

iOS 6 surpassed not only the recent Jelly Bean release of Android, but also the year-old release of [Ginger Bread](http://www.informationweek.com/development/mobility/android-40-ice-cream-sandwich-adoption-j/240004808). And it did it in _three days_.

If each copy of iOS 6 is about 900MB (the size of the download form Apple's Developer Portal), and it was downloaded 100 million times, that's 90 _petabytes_ of data transfer in three days, while Apple also updates OS X _and_ a new iPhone 5 _and_ continuing to run its other online services like the App Store, iTunes Match, etc.

That's incredible.
