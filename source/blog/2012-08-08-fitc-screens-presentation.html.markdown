I'm presenting a talk at the FITC Screens conference this September in Toronto; it's a "developer's behind the scenes" presentation of the 500px iPad app, and you should totally [check it out](http://www.fitc.ca/events/presentations/presentation.cfm?event=134&presentation_id=2044).



I'm very excited and grateful for the opportunity to present a story about our efforts at such a prestigious venue. Adam and I are designing the presentation now, which should be a hoot. We're targeting anyone who's involved in the mobile development process, so whether you're a designer, developer, CEO, product manager, or customer support representative, I think you'll find something of value in our talk. Come learn from our experiences.
