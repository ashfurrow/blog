So lsat week was pretty huge for [App.net](https://alpha.app.net). Tapbots, makes of the most stylish of iOS apps, released a Tweetbot lookalike named [Netbot](http://tapbots.com/software/netbot/). Along with an alpha of an OS X app named [Wedge](http://wedge.natestedman.com), I've found a spot of App.net in my day-to-day routine, as I'm sure many other nerds have.

I took a look at what was going on in my stream, and I decided that these discussions were worth participating in.

App.net is a group of nerds who are taking their conversations seriously. It's ... different from Twitter. Not better, not worse, just different.

What you get out of these services is exactly proportional to what you put into them. Twitter will keep being Twitter; I'm excited to see what happens on App.net.

If only they could just come out and call it "alpha", I'd be a lot happier.
