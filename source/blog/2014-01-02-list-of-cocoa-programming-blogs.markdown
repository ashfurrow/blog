I'm very happy to share [Ole Begemann's list of favourite Cocoa blogs](http://oleb.net/blog/2013/12/my-favorite-cocoa-programming-blogs/). Very happy not solely because it's a great list of blogs, but because _this_ blog made it onto the list.

I know I didn't do as much writing here as I wanted to in 2013, but I'm looking forward to doing more of it, and more open source contributions, in the coming twelve months. Cheers!
