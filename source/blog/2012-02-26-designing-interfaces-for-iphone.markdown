I gave a presentation this morning at [Podcamp Toronto](http://2012.podcamptoronto.com/) about designing interfaces for iPhone. The talk was a high-level description of how to organize and structure content in iPhone apps. The slides are available [Here](https://speakerdeck.com/ashfurrow/designing-interfaces-for-iphone).

Also, I release the slides under Creative Commons.
