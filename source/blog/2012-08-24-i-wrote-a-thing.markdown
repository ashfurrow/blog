<p>So, I've been a little quiet about this on twitter, probably out of a weird Canadian sense of humbleness, but I co-authored a book this year with Jim Dovey. You should <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430243686/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1430243686&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ashfur-20">go buy it</a>. I wrote the beginning chapters on the likes of Foundation, while Jim tackled the more interesting topics such as Core Data and iCloud (about which his massive experience qualifies him to speak on with authority). </p>

<p>It was an incredible learning experience. The chapters are nearly complete with chapter proofs being approved nearly daily. I'm really excited, but I don't know if I'm going to work with publishers again. I value writing on my own schedule too much to adhere to someone else's schedule. </p>

<p>I've chosen a self-publishing platform and have began planning another book. Except some exciting things this Fall.</p>
