The frequency of my posts here has dropped over the past 4 weeks or so, due primarily to a crunch mode I've been in at work since mid-September.

I'm not going to go into the circumstances that led to having to work 70 hours a week because it doesn't matter; the work has to get done, and our team has done a heroic job. I'm really proud of all that we've accomplished.

However, I'm burnt out. I feel myself thinking slower and every line of code I write now feels like a compromise.

I need time to invest into my side-projects. I'm going to Montreal in a few weeks with some friends to take photos, I'm signing a deal for a new book, and I've got two talks on iOS software accessibility coming up that I'm really looking forward to giving.

On Tuesday, I find out if everything we've been working on has been worth it. After that, I'm planning on taking time off to recover. I don't think I'll be back on top of my game for weeks.
