My friend Tom published an interesting post this morning about [copying the _wrong_ part of idea](http://tomcreighton.com/2012/05/cloning-the-ios-ecosystem/). The post is based on something stupid someone commented on Hacker News, and I want to expand on that a little bit.

Let's talk about people saying stupid things on Hacker News. <!--more-->

This isn't the typical "people say stupid things online" problem because people on Hacker News are genuinely smart; their reasoning skills are top-notch and they're obviously capable of rational thought. What comments on Hacker News lack is _empathy_.

Commenters on Hacker News suffer from a severe case of collective egocentrism; they are unable (or unwilling) to see things form another's perspective. From their perspective as developers, it makes sense for them to think something should be a certain way. However, when you consider things from another perspective, say, that of a typical user (or, heaven forgive me for using the term, _customer_), their assertions seem rather childish.

When you say something _should_ be some way because you _want_ something to be that way, you're throwing yourself under [Hume's Guillotine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem). (side note: what a badass term. I couldn't _not_ use it.)

I've removed Hacker News from my Top Sites for the same reason I stopped visiting Slashdot years ago; the comments became so inane and negative that I couldn't stand it anymore. I'm not saying Hacker News needs to change, just that there are implications for this growing trend of this self-congratulatory negativism of their comments.
