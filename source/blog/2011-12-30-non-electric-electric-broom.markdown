Ashley and I just purchased a new household appliance: it's a non electric, electric broom! It does everything I love about my vacuum cleaner, like cleaning the floor, but its near-silent operation means I can quickly clean up a spill even late at night, even if my upstairs neighbours aren't nearly as considerate in their use of hot water. It's efficient, manually operated, and best of all, it's _bagless_, so it's great for the environment!&nbsp;
