2013 has been an interesting year for me. The year was born out of the ruins of a relationship with my old employer, who I had previously admired. I gave my letter of resignation my first day back after the Christmas holidays.

I landed at Teehan+Lax February 1st. T+L is just today [celebrating its eleventh birthday](http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/11-years-of-teehanlax/). I read Jon's post about the anniversary. Twice. In the face of enormous obstacles, the leaders of the company I work for chose to stand their ground, show their employees respect, and act in a dignified way. I couldn't be happier to work here.

I've been battling with [depression](/blog/depression) since mid last year. I feel like recently I've rounded a corner to the finish line of regaining my complete sanity. Working at T+L has been a big part of that, and I wouldn't be where I am today without working in such a stable, supportive environment.
