I just returned home from watching _The Dark Knight Rises_, the completion to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy. I had hoped, even though time and again I'm shown that the third act of a trilogy never lives up to expectations, that this time would be different.

Oops.



Christopher Nolan disappointed us in his usual manner, with a series of non-sequiturs and instances of disregard for the linear nature of time which, when glossed over for the sake of enjoying the _action_, provide an otherwise thrilling experience. He certainly did not fail to live up to his reputation. However, I'm more than a little disappointed by the script's disrespect for the art of storytelling.

After the first two films, and knowing that you're seeing a movie about _a man dressed as a bat_, any audience member would be comfortable with a healthy amount of camp, cliché, and cheese. The dialogue tawdrily tip-toed around the issues of these realities with such awkwardness that not even the superb acting of Nolan's Band of Merry Men could make sound anything but self-aware.

Not only was the dialogued spoiled by maladroit exchanges between the characters, but the script (and film's editing) left almost nothing to the imagination. _Batman Begins_ used subtlety and innuendo to deftly narrate a fantastic origin story. Contrast that with _The Dark Knight Rises_, which refuses to take the chance that any member of the audience might miss out on even the slightest of allusions.

In short, I think I would enjoy seeing this film again, but I would have to suspend all belief that this story could plausibly be possible; it is a far cry from the compelling story-telling we saw in Acts I and II.
