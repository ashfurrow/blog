title: UICollectionView Presentation

I did a presentation on `UICollectionView` at [TACOW](http://tacow.org) last night. The presentation is a little different than I normally do for a technical talk because I didn't go through the API, but rather focused on the three most important messages to remember when working with `UICollectionView`:

1. `UICollectionView` is just like `UITableView`.
2. `UICollectionView` separates dequeuing logic from display and layout.
3. `UICollectionView` makes complex layouts easy.

I didn't go over the minutiae of how to use them because there is the documentation for that. I focused on the what rather than the how â€“ I tried to inspire my audience with what was possible instead of being tied down with implementation details.
