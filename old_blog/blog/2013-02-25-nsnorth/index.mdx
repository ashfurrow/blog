Just a reminder that I'll be attending [NSNorth](http://nsnorth.ca) in April.

The topics are more high-level than nitty-gritty, but that's good. Every conference can't be a WWDC-inspired technical tour.

There's a good speaker line-up, including my friend [Jason](https://twitter.com/jasonbrennan).

Definitely worth the trip to Ottawa if you're available.
