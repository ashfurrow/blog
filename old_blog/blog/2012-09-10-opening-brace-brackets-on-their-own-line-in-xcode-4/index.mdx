title: Opening Brace Brackets on Their Own Line in Xcode 4
date: 2012-09-10
---


If you're like me, you like your brace backets on their own lines, like this:

```
if (condition)
{
    statements
}
```

If you're even more like me, you make heavy use of Xcode's autocomplete and snippets, like the following:

And finally, if you're _just_ like me, you get really disappointed when this happens:

```
if (condition) {
    statements
}
```

What the hell, Xcode? Even the project templates have brace brackets on their own lines. What gives?

Thanks to [some research](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5324622/how-to-change-autocomplete-braces-in-xcode-4), I found the [file](http://forrst.com/posts/Put_that_where_it_might_belong_Xcode-PNL) you need to edit. The problem is, Xcode is now distributed through the Mac App Store, so the steps are a little different. Here's what you do.

1. Open the terminal. 
2. Type `cd /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/PlugIns/IDECodeSnippetLibrary.ideplugin/Contents/Resources` and hit Enter.
3. We're editing `SystemCodeSnippets.codesnippets`, but let's make a backup first. Type `sudo cp SystemCodeSnippets.codesnippets SystemCodeSnippets.codesnippets.backup` and hit Enter.
4. Use your text editor of choice to open the file as the root user.
  - Using vim, the command is `sudo vim SystemCodeSnippets.codesnippets`
  - Using anything else, like TextMake, it's `sudo open -a TextMate SystemCodeSnippets.codesnippets`
5. 

Do a "Find" for the word "condition" and you should find almost all the instance of the snippets you want to modify. It'll look like this:

```
<key>IDECodeSnippetVersion</key>
    <integer>1</integer>
   <key>IDECodeSnippetCompletionPrefix</key>
    <string>if</string>
    <key>IDECodeSnippetContents</key>
    <string>if (&lt;#condition#&gt;) {
&lt;#statements#&gt;
}</string>
```

Just put a new line before the opening brace bracket.

```
<key>IDECodeSnippetVersion</key>
    <integer>1</integer>
    <key>IDECodeSnippetCompletionPrefix</key>
    <string>if</string>
    <key>IDECodeSnippetContents</key>
    <string>if (&lt;#condition#&gt;)
{
&lt;#statements#&gt;
}</string>
```

This will find all the if statements and most loops; search for the text "forin" to modify the fast enumeration snippet.

Save the file and restart Xcode. That's it!

**Update** : My friend Zev is maintaining an up-to-date version of `SystemCodeSnippets.codesnippets` for the latest Xcode version [on GitHub](https://github.com/sveinungkb/ios-convenience). Go check it out.
