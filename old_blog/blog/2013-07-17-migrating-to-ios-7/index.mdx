title: Migrating to iOS 7

Gruber said it right the other day. The time to start thinking about iOS 7 was a month ago.

I wrote an article about what app owners [need to do now](http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/migrating-to-ios-7/) in order to be ready for day one. It's a tremendous opportunity, really, since Apple is likely to consider featuring you in your category.

This is also my first article ever to be linked to by [The Loop](http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/07/17/keeping-your-app-relevant-when-ios-7-is-released/), so it's something of a milestone for me. Onward and upward!
