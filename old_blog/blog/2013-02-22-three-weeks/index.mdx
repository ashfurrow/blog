So I've been at [Teehan+Lax](http://www.teehanlax.com) now for three weeks, and while I'm still in the honeymoon phase, I can confidently say that I've made the right choice.

I'm focusing on the aspects of development that are important to me because they're the same aspects that are important to the company. I'm making amazing things and exploring emerging technologies in ways I never expected.

Now that I've left my old workplace, moved, and finished writing my latest book, I've felt less stressed and more relaxed. I can't remember the last time I've felt this happy.
