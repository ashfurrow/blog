[Mark Rothko](https://www.artsy.net/artist/mark-rothko), frustrated with an obtuse interviewer, [is claimed to have explained](https://youtu.be/qFnNgTSkHPM?t=412) his art by exclaiming: "you’ve got sadness in you, I’ve got sadness in me – and my works of art are places where the two sadnesses can meet, and therefore both of us need to feel less sad." As a musician, that really resonates with me. Sometimes, a sad song is exactly what I need to hear (or play) to feel better.

So I present: [three sad and sappy songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pIf5VPhmco&list=PLBygl72DbBTHIpDE63lPSvddwHs6FbgRQ), because it's 2018 and we need something else to feel sad about for just a few minutes of relief.

(This is my second year playing guitar at Artsy Salon, after [debuting on guitar](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/guitar-debut/) last year. I'm really happy with how far I've progressed since then – I feel so much more comfortable performing in front of people.
