title: Objective-C Singleton Macro
date: 2011-04-01

My friend [Paddy](https://twitter.com/#!/tapi) showed me an awesome macro for generating single classes, shown [here](https://pastebin.com/yfgc28dR). You'd use it like:

```objc
SYNTHESIZE_SINGLE_FOR_CLASS(class_name);

//instance methods go here!

@end
```

This is pretty sweet - if you're using the Singleton pattern a lot, and let's face it, it's always something we mean to do, this is a lifesaver since Singleton code is all copy-and-paste.
