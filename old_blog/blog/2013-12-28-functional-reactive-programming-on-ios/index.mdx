I've (finally) finished my book on ReactiveCocoa, [Functional Reactive Programming on iOS](https://leanpub.com/iosfrp). If you were ever interested in learning about ReactiveCocoa but didn't know where to start, here you go.

All the source code discussed in the book is [open](https://github.com/AshFurrow/FunctionalReactivePixels) and licensed under the MIT license.

I'd really appreciate anything you could do to help spread the word. Every little bit helps!
