So a few weeks ago, I was listening to my new favourite Podcast [_What a Time to Be Alive_][pod] and the hosts mentioned a different show. This Tom Scharpling guy apparently has a show and they revered it a bit actually. The name sounded kinda familiar and I made a note to check him out later.


Well so this Tom fella is listed in the Apple Podcasts as running [_Best Show_][best], so I checked it out. About... thirty seconds into the first episode I froze. My eyes dilated and defocused. I held my breath.

"Wait a minute."

I double-checked on IMDb.

Tom Scharpling is the voice actor behind my favourite character on my [favourite show][su]: Greg Universe. I've already been listening to this guy and I didn't know it! And he was a writer and producer on _Monk_, which played a big role in my formative years. (I'd never seen a protagonist depicted with a mental illness before.)

Okay so that's pretty cool, right? Well I kept reading up on him and he's been involved with a bunch of musicians that I like, over many years. Very cool! I kept digging. 

[_Best Show_ has been running][bw] for well over a decade, with many people now attributing the rise of podcasting _in general_ to this show. Some describe him as the "Godfather Of Podcasting", according to [Wikipedia][wiki]. Very cool! I've run a number of podcasts over the years and they've all be influential on my career. My first was just with [some friends and colleagues in 2011][f], but I later did an [interview series][s] with established developers who described their origin stories – because we all start from somewhere – and finally I did [another iOS news show][nc]. (All the shows are defunct and offline, sorry. Welllll, one of them [is archived][archive] but you should absolutely not listen to it.) The point is, I probably wouldn't have gotten into podcasting if not for the zeitgeist around the medium in 2011, which Tom Scharpling helped create.

So this person, who I didn't even know about really, has been influencing my life for well over a decade. My personal life, my career, my art. Wow. And I didn't even know his name. Prettttty cool!
