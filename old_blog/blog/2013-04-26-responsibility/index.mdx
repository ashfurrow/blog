Since I was little, I've always wanted to be a teacher. In university, I did a lot of tutoring, but after a Summer doing research, I decided that a career in academia was not for me.

Still, I loved teaching. More than the love of teaching, I felt a responsibility to teach. No one gets where they are on their own. We all have help from mentors, friends, and Stack Overflow. I write, blog, and podcast not just because I enjoy teaching, but because I feel a responsibility to pass on knowledge.

Yesterday, tickets for Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference sold out in less than two minutes. I'm one of the lucky 5 000 people who got a ticket. All of us have a responsibility to gather bugs to report to the Apple engineers and to learn from the sessions to teach others what we learn.
