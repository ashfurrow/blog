_A blog post in five tweets._

So we all know about Dash, eh? [Apple acted rashly against an indie dev](https://blog.kapeli.com/apple-removed-dash-from-the-app-store), [the developer called them on it](https://blog.kapeli.com/dash-and-apple-my-side-of-the-story), and the iOS developer community failed to rally behind the developer like it should have.

Apple is [just a company](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/crestfallen/). I know we all like them, and we want them to do well, but sometimes Apple will fail to live up to our ideals and our expectations. We've got to be ready to hold them accountable.
