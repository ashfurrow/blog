title: Eidolon Retrospective
date: 2014-11-13

For the past few months, I've been working on a new iOS app for Artsy, codenamed "[Eidolon](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon)". I think it's cool for a couple of reasons: it's open source, it's in Swift, and it uses ReactiveCocoa. Now that our team had some time to sit down and reflect on our experience developing it, 


I've written a [retrospective on the project](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/) that goes into detail about some of the decisions we made. This is the story of how Eidolon came to be, not a description of the different technologies we used. 

If you have any questions about any part of our process, let me know on twitter and I'd be happy to answer them.
