Hey! So not a lot of posts over the past six months, what's Ash been up to, eh? Well, besides moving to a new apartment, and [blogging for Artsy](http://artsy.github.io/author/ash/), I've been learning more JavaScript! Specifically, a lot more about JS tooling. 

Last night, I gave [my first meetup talk](https://www.meetup.com/TypeScriptNYC/events/255170060/) in the JavaScript developer community at [TypeScript NYC](https://www.meetup.com/TypeScriptNYC/). It went really well!


I did a live coding demo of how to write custom [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/) rules. TSLint is a tool that checks your [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) code for style problems. You can think of it like [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint), but for TypeScript. I've been working on some TSLint rules at Artsy and I thought I would share what I've learned over the past month or so.

The talk wasn't recorded, but [the slides are available](https://speakerdeck.com/ashfurrow/building-custom-tslint-rules) and the [steps I took are documented](https://github.com/ashfurrow/tsnyc-tslint-rules/blob/master/STEPS.md). I also have [further reading in this readme](https://github.com/ashfurrow/tslint-playground). The meetup audience was very patient and helpful as I worked through the live-coding demo, and were appropriately mind-blown at the end of the talk. I'll definitely come back to this meetup, because the other talks were really interesting, too.

In 2018, I've had a blast learning more about module resolution, Babel, the TypeScript compiler, and more. It's a really exciting time for me because I'm starting to feel both productive and confident when working in Artsy's various JS-based projects. I've said this before, but I don't consider myself an "iOS developer" anymore because the title is too limiting. I solve problems; sometimes that means [hunting down crashes in Objective-C](https://github.com/artsy/emission/pull/1211) and sometimes that means [sending the TypeScript compiler a pull request](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/pull/28196).

I'm excited.
