I'm very excited about [The Magainze](http://the-magazine.org). I enjoy reading the types of articles it features, and in fact, I want to write one myself.

More than just that, though, I just love the fact that this exists. Paying writers is something I want to support. $2/month is very nearly no money to me, and if for no other reason than simply to encourage this type of thing to exist, I'll subscribe.
