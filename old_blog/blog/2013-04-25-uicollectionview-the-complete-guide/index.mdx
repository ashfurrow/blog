My second book, [UICollectionView: The Complete Guide](http://www.informit.com/store/ios-uicollectionview-the-complete-guide-9780133410945) ( [Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CFLTD50/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CFLTD50&linkCode=as2&tag=ashfur-20)) was released this week.

It's a relatively short eBook at 176 pages, but I cover every aspect of using `UICollectionView`. It's only $20 (cheaper on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CFLTD50/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CFLTD50&linkCode=as2&tag=ashfur-20)), so if you're looking for a comprehensive walkthrough of the framework, this is perfect.
