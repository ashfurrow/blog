I've got a new podcast, called [The Master Branch](http://themasterbranch.com/), with Tom and Adam that's worth checking out. Same great stuff as before, exciting new format.

> How do constraints breed creativity? Will a more creative experience yield a better product? How far can we push this metaphor? Where does Kickstarter fit within an economy based primarily on software? Why is Twitter acting like such a dick?

Check it out. Let me know what you think.
