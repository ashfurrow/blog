title: Toroid Milk Frothing Pitcher

I brought a shitty old Breville milk frothing pitcher into work when Evgeny and Oleg bought the office a Rocky/Silvia combo (awesome!). The milk pitcher doesn't have a spout, is way too large, and everyone's been dissatisfied with it. Last week, I bought a [Toroid 12oz milk pitcher](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054SCEZC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ashfur-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0054SCEZC), and the results have been fantastic.

You can't see it from the pictures online, but the toroid features a very unique shape on the underside that makes it easy to foam milk. No, like properly foam milk, even with a shitty $80 espresso machine. You point the steam wand straight at the bottom of the pitcher and it takes care of the whirlpool action for you; the steam pressure creates a kind of torus shape called a _toroid&nbsp;_(get it?) and so you just lower and raise the pitcher to create the however much foam you want. Couldn't be easier.

I've been using one at home for over 6 months and I couldn't be happier.

Let me make this simple for you: if you're making milk-based espresso drinks and you're not happy with the results, you just need to go buy this. It's incredible.

Get it on Amazon in [12oz](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0054SCEZC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ashfur-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0054SCEZC) and [20oz](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LDZFEW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ashfur-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005LDZFEW) versions (I'd recommend the 12oz).
