title: UICollectionView Example with UICollectionViewFlowLayout

I'm waiting for some friends to come into town tonight so I thought I might throw together a very [basic `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` example](https://github.com/AshFurrow/UICollectionViewFlowLayoutExample).

It demonstrates proper use of:

- `UICollectionViewFlowLayout` properties and basic subclassing.
- How to properly implement `UICollectionViewCell` subclasses.
- How to change layouts (with animation).
- How to set up a collection view without a `.xib` or Storyboard.

Important things to note:

- Always invalidate a layout before setting giving it to a collection view to use. This is really important if your app supports more than one orientation.
- Always reset `UICollectionViewCell`s to neutral when you override `prepareForReuse`.
- Always use `setCollectionViewLayout:animated:` to change a layout with animation â€“ _never_ set the property in an animation block and assume it will work.

These are just a few of the gems I've picked up while writing a short book on `UICollectionView`. I'll let you know when it's available for sale.

I'll probably add more layouts to it other than small and large ones. If anyone has anything they want to add or suggestions, let me know.
