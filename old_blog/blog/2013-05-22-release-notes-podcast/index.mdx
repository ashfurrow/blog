Go check out [Release Notes](http://releasenotes.tv), a new podcast for iOS from a pair of pretty smart dudes.

Yeah, I know, _another_ podcast about iOS, but this one is diffrent. It doesn't talk about design or coding, but rather the _business_ of iOS. Definitely worth checking out.

Their [inaugural episode](http://releasenotes.tv/1-conference-junkies/) is about conferences and it discusses the value of conferences, how to choose one to attend, and how to get the most out of it.
