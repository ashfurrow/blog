Some of my oldest memories are of riding in my father's 1998 red Toyota 4runner listening to a cassette tape of the Moxy Fr√ºvous album _Bargainville_ (1993). I was walking this morning and I put the album on and it still really speaks to me.

I was always fond of _River Valley_ because it's a catchy tune, and I grew up in a river valley. Listening to it today, during the incipient climate collapse, is chilling.

> Is your favourite place controlled by developing ambitions?

> Do you think you'll have some power signing a petition?

> Are you fine with your surroundings? Are they gonna crumble?

Anyway. I kept listening, and kept hearing the same sort of left-wing anthems come through. I mean, this seems on the nose by contemporary standards, but in the 90's this was somewhat subversive stuff.

> He wakes up to "Homeless are stupid, welfare is stupid

> Private investment, efficiency, cool fiscal plannin'"

> Sounds like more Pat Buchanan

Anyway, if you're interested in listening to 90's Canadian folk rock, you could do a lot worse than _Bargainville_.
