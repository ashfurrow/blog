title: Microsoft Disables Thousands of Fonts in Security Update

Microsoft issued a security update to Windows, labeled "high priority", which has [disabled many, many fonts](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/12/17/windows_security_update_kills_fonts/) installed on PCs. Designers are crying bloody murder.

I cannot imagine Apple doing something like this with OS X. Granted, Apple would have just left the security flaw unpatched for months, but they would not have broken the typographic system they have worked so hard to create. I can't image that this was the only way to patch the flaw â€” certainly, Microsoft, there's another option?
