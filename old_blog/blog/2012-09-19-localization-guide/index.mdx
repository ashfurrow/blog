[Chris Forsythe](https://twitter.com/the_tick), the developer behind [Growl](http://growl.info), has written a [fantastic article](http://336699.org/localization-is-a-requirement-heres-a-guide) detailing what localization is, why it's important, and some fantastic tips, tricks, and resources to help.

> The result of this shift now has Growl at 24 languages and growing at a rapid pace, so these steps were pretty effective.

Fantastic. My personal apps could definitely use some more localization love. Maybe that'll be a weekend project.
