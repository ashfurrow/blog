I'm very happy to announce that I've been added to the [Fusion Ad Network](http://fusionads.net)'s list of publishers. This network includes some of my favourite tech writers, including [Stephen Hackett](http://512pixels.net), [Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com), and [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net).

The goal of my blog has always been, first and foremost, to write about things I am passionate about. I've been refining my professional and writing skills to work towards the goal of becoming authoritative on Objective-C and iOS development. I still have a _long_ way to go, and this blog will document the whole journey.

Making money has never been the goal for me - elevating my writing to the point where it is serious enough to advertise against has been. I'm really looking forward to what's in store.
