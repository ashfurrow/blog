I just read a [really interesting article about side projects](http://blog.joshlong.me/no-such-thing-as-side-projects).

> If you know me or know of any of these projects, you’ll know that none of them are side projects. They’re serious projects each with their own goals and execution of those goals. They’re businesses and passion projects all at the same time. I simply don’t work any other way.

This really resonated with me. I've got a lot on my plate (especially in the last year or so) and try to treat all of my endeavours seriously.
