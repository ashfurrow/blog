The [latest episode](http://themasterbranch.com/2013/03/episode-5-%E2%80%93-jailbreak-your-restaurant/) of the podcast I cohost is up!

> What does buying software entitle a user to? We segue into to grand debate over the moral imperative software creators have to consider how their creations change society.
