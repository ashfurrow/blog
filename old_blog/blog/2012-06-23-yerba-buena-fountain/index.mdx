I took this photo at WWDC 2012 with my (new at the time) Sony point-and-shoot. It was over a year before I even thought of buying a DSLR and I hadn't done any research into serious photography.

It's not a fantastic photo, but it's not bad for someone with no experience or knowledge trying to capture an interesting subject. It reinforces a feeling I've had lately that, no matter what, even if I hadn't started working at 500px, I would have eventually become a photographer because it's a form of expression that I've been interested in for a long time.

I was looking forward to returning to Yerba Buena Gardens to recapture this but, sadly, the fountain is under construction.
