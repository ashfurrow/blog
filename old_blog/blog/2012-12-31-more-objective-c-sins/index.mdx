Brent Simmons has a fantastic [reponse post](http://inessential.com/2012/12/31/coders_in_the_hands_of_an_angry_god) to my earlier [deadly Objective-C sins](/blog/seven-deadly-sins-of-modern-objective-c) article. In it, he lists quite a few ones, and my favourites involve the static analylzer and compiler warnings: treat warnings as errors and turn on all the warnings.

Bam.

You're code just got, like, instantly more stable. Once you fix all the warnings, that is.

It's a fantastic list â€” anyone looking to improve their Objective-C chops this year would do well to read it.
