I'm really excited to tell you all about my new [Core Data Course](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-diary-app-using-core-data) at [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com).

The course covers the basics of Core Data and includes steps to create a re-usable, general-purpose Core Data stack. It covers what managed objects are and where they live in a typical Core Data stack, and much more. I had a blast recording this course and I hope that you enjoy it.

Check out the trailer video for more.
