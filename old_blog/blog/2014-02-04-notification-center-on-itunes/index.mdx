My new podcast, [Notification Center](http://notificationcenter.tv), has been added to the iTunes podcast directory [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/notification-center/id812164680). As part of the iTunes catalogue, you should be able to find it and subscribe to it in your favourite third-party podcatcher. (At the moment, mine is [Network](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/network-podcasts-client/id723422355?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3v6zC)).

Go check it out, subscribe, and leave a review. We'll be recording and releasing a new episode this weekend.
