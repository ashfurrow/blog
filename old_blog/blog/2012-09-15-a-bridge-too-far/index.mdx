Turns out, Google has a [Java-to-Objective-C converter](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/09/15/google_j2objc_tool/).

> "Several Google projects rely on [J2ObjC], but when new projects first start working with it, they usually find new bugs to be fixed," reads a statement on the project homepage. "Apparently every Java developer has a slightly different way of using Java, and the tool hasn't translated all possible paths yet."

_Awesome_. Exactly the kind of thing you want to be dealing with, fixing bugs in a language bridge.

If you're going to write Android apps, use Java. If you're going to write iOS apps, use Objective-C. What ever happened to the right tool for the right job?

I guess the authors of J2ObjC are emacs users. _ducks_
