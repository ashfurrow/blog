The other day, [this article on self care](http://eponis.tumblr.com/post/113798088670/everything-is-awful-and-im-not-okay-questions-to) floated across my timeline. I took a look and it looks like a very useful tool for anyone struggling with depression. 


It's a great piece of writing â€“ basic questions, but things that can sometimes feel like unachievable goals in a depressive episode. Thinks like making sure you're hydrated, getting you to stretch, and having human contact like a hug. 

I'll add my own piece of advice, something that has helped me recover from difficult mornings. Remember that it is never too late to start the day over again. 

The author was kind enough to create a [printable Google Doc](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6A2F5ky9SELU0Zfd05YMEpyNUk/view) that's well-organized. They also released it under Creative Commons, which is awesome. I'm [hosting a PDF on my site](http://static.ashfurrow.com/selfcare_printable.pdf) in case theirs goes down for some reason.
