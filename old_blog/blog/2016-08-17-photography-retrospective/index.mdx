In February of 2012, I wrote that [I would not be buying a camera](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/effort-to-improved-skill-ratio-and-expertise/). Two months later, [I did buy one](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/so-i-bought-a-camera/), and that decision has come to shape a lot of who I am today.

It's funny how four years seems like a long time, but also feels really short, too. Photography exploded into my life, taking up all my spare time, attention, and money. I knew it would when I started. After all, I've always loved gadgets and gizmos, and photography is rife with things to fiddle with and obsess over.

I kept buying nicer and nicer lenses, and nicer and nicer cameras, until I had "the setup", what I thought would signal to other photographers (and myself) that I was serious about photography. It was never enough. I had a problem. I felt addicted to buying gear. I would feel crummy and think that buying such-and-such new photography thing would make me feel better, and it did, but that elation would quickly subside when I realized that I _shouldn't have bought that_. So that would make me feel crummy too and the cycle would repeat.

Buying photography gear was an unhealthy coping mechanism that I used to deal with my [depression](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/depression/), but eventually I did manage to stop before I did unrepairable damage to my marriage and finances. When I moved to New York, I got the help I needed, and that's made recovery from "gear acquisition syndrome" possible.

That's the dark side of my photography. But there's a good side, too: photography is a huge, positive part of my life â€“ in both lofty and day-to-day senses. Let me explain both.

I wanted _so much_ to feel like a "real photographer", and I bought gear that I thought would help. That wasn't smart, but it did lead to making making a lot of photos, and that _did_ help me feel like a photographer. More than that, I eventually stopped caring about how I appear to others as a photographer; photography has become something I do _for me_.

Buying gear didn't help, but actually using the gear I had _did_. And eventually, I learnt that it didn't really matter anyway.

Today, a camera accompanies me everywhere I go. Every time I leave my apartment, I have my camera in my bag, and the camera is already in my hand by the time my feet hit the sidewalk.

Photography taught me to [learn from my mistakes](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/developers-should-learn-photography/); if a photo didn't turn out the way I wanted, I figured out why. Once I found out what went wrong, I tried not to do it again.

A lot of the choices I've made haven't turned out for the best, but I'm learning from them.

This summer has actually been the first time in my life that I haven't lived paycheque-to-paycheque. It sucks that it took until my late twenties to get my shit together, but I want to concentrate on the fact that _I'm actually getting my shit together_. And honestly, photography only exacerbated an obsession with buying things. But, it did help in unique ways that I think only art could have. It taught me lessons I've applied to other parts of my life, and it now helps take my mind off things when I do feel down. It's become a healthy coping mechanism.

If I could go back and explain all this to myself in 2012, when I was buying my first camera, I'm not sure my younger self would understand. It's like [monads](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/), you can't explain how they work because that comprehension can only come from struggling with them. You can't take a shortcut. With buying photography gear, I didn't understand how I was hurting myself until I had struggled for a while. Maybe the struggle was necessary. In any case, I'm glad it's ending.

So that's my retrospective on photography, at least so far: a hobby-turned-obsession that cost a lot of money and caused a lot of stress, but also a hobby that became a healthy coping mechanism with a lot of fun. Like most everything, photography hasn't been "good" or "bad", but a bit of both. I can live with that.
