title: Subtle Controls

Recently, I developed two open source UIKit controls you can easily use in your apps. They are called [TLTiltHighlightView](https://github.com/TeehanLax/TLTiltHighlightView) and [TLTiltSlider](https://github.com/TeehanLax/TLTiltSlider). I call them "tilt" becuase they adjust their appearance depending on how you hold your device.

These controls mimic the subtle effects present in the iOS 6 music app. It shows the attention to detail that Apple demonstrates. It's a bar they set that we should all try and surpass.
