Consider a UISegmentedControl at the top of the table view that lets users list table view cells in either category. A user can switch which category a cell belongs to.

I thought it'd be cool to animate the table view cell moving into the other side of the segmented control - much like moving an email to another folder in the Mail app. 12 seconds later, I realized it would take a little more than a UIView animation block, and would be out of scope. Google didn't yield any easy results, unfortunately.

So I wrote it myself. The resulting UITableViewCell category (called ShrinkTo).

The code is freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AshFurrow/UITableViewCell-ShinkTo).
