So I've been running the [mastodon.technology][instance] instance of [Mastodon][mastodon] since April, and I've written about different things I've learned while administering a server and contributing to the project. One thing I've only recent learned about is [log rotation][wikipedia]: an automatic task to prevent log files from filling up a disk.

This relates to a problem I had a month ago. My primary disk filled up, prevent media uploads from working for a few hours (the database was unaffected since it uses a separate disk). The problem was exacerbated by an [issue][issue] I've been having with Sidekiq log file sizes, but the root of the issue is that I wasn't rotating Mastodon log files at all. I was just logging in about once a week to do restart the docker containers (thereby clearing the logs). But I forgot one week.

I asked some colleagues for advice and they told me about log rotation. So I added the following new, named `/etc/logrotate.d/docker-container` (see [this helpful post][post]).

```
/var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log {
  rotate 7
  daily
  compress
  size=1M
  missingok
  delaycompress
  copytruncate
}
```

This moves the log contents to a new file and compresses previously moved logs, so I get a disk use increase of about 50MB/day instead of 1GB/day.

Obviously the logs are still growing, but the instance could now run for months without me restarting docker containers and not run out of disk space. Nice.

And I think Docker has this kind of functionality built in now, but this is working so I'm running with it.

So yeah, logrotate.d is another [minor skill][xkcd] I've added to my tool belt that's come from working on and administering Mastodon.
