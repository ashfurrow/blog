title: Fear of Missing Out

I've been thinking a lot about my anxiety lately, and I think that the root of it all is a fear of missing out. On what? On anything. That lost opportunity. The one that got away. That fear – that I might be missing out on something – has caused me a great deal of anxiety in my life so far, and I've grown tired of it. So I've decided not to let it bother me anymore.

My friend asked me recently if I ever regretted not pursuing some startup opportunity during my degree. He meant, if I had to do it all over again, would I have stuck with school, or would I have done something else, something potentially lucrative.

The question intrigued me. I thought about it, and I came up with this answer. I'm incredibly happy with where I am in my life and career, and every single decision I've made has lead me to where I am today. How could I regret any of them?
