I'm having a good chuckle this morning over a bunch of Harvard professors up-in-arms over the university administration [searching their email accounts](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/us/harvard-e-mail-search-stuns-faculty-members.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0).

> "I think what the administration did was creepy," said Mary C. Waters, a sociology professor, adding that "this action violates the trust I once had that Harvard would never do such a thing."

Guess what, professor J. Obvlivious, you don't _own_ that email account. Your employer does. This goes for everyone, too.

Harvard legitimately searched emails for a the person who created a scandal that lead to to 70 students being forced to leave the school. This isn't a case of misuse of power, this is a case of "don't be a douchebag" and a lesson in keeping your private messages off your company email.
