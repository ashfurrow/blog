title: Apple Dev Center Breach
date: 2013-07-24

The Apple developer portal has been down since last Thursday. With iOS 7 imminent, the timing couldn't be worse.

The alleged attacker, Ibrahim Balic, has [claimed to have information](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/21/apple-confirms-that-the-dev-center-has-potentially-been-breached-by-hackers/?hubRefSrc=permalink#lf_comment=87472293) about 100 000+ users. He also claims to have done this with whitehat intentions.

We don't know how long he waited between reporting the secrity issue to Apple before he infiltrated the system. We don't know much at all, actually.

However, I can't help but feel very frustrated that his "research" has severely impacted the ability for six million registered developers to do their job.
