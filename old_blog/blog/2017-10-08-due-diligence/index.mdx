Okay so yesterday I wrote a [hypothetical blog post](/blog/apple-releases-jive/) about a new testing framework that Apple made. I've got a lot of feedback – more than I expected, honestly. Developers really care about their tools.


One piece of criticism I received is that I hadn't filed any bug reports with Apple asking for these features. I did include a link to [Apple's bug reporter](http://bugreport.apple.com) and asked people to file radars, but I didn't provide any radars to duplicate. That was an oversight on my part.

So here's some due diligence: I have filed eleven radars with Apple asking for individual features that would each enhance the developer experience. They have all been cross-posted to [Open Radar](http://www.openradar.me/), so please feel free to duplicate them.

- [34875844 Xcode's unit testing framework should include a mocking library](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=4928269132496896)
- [34875826 Hot Module Reloading](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5060966442074112)
- [34875798 Open source Xcode, or make a new OSS Xcode Lite](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=4970395111260160)
- [34875762 Run unit tests in parallel processes/simulators](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5011363730554880)
- [34875753 Xcode unit testing should support Behaviour-Driven Development workflows](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5055377615880192)
- [34875723 Matchers that ship with Xcode's testing framework could be improved](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6135499479580672)
- [34875713 Xcode should schedule failing tests to run first](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5025044409352192)
- [34873674 Xcode should only run tests related to files changed since the last commit](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=4959620246274048)
- [34873507 Add a test-on-save feature](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6063405903380480)
- [34873492 Unit tests always run in the same order, but should be randomized](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=4937505996537856)
- [34876469	Isolate global state between tests by isolating tests](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=5001137547640832)

These are _all_ feature requests that I'm bringing from other communities – mainly Ruby and JavaScript. I've been [asking developers to bring ideas from other communities since Swift was in beta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtrzZb5Jw0g). It's fair to ask me to follow my own advice.

What features would make your day-to-day life as a developer easier, or more joyful?
