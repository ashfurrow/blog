> Americano. noun ( pl. Americanos ) a drink of espresso diluted with hot water.

There are few words I hate more than "americano." It epitomizes the North American practice of appropriating a thing that has to be hand crafted and turning into a mass-produced&nbsp;approximation.

You want an americano? No, you want a espresso done long black.
