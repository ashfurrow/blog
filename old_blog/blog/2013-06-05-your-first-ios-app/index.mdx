I finished writing my book. The [first chapter is available online, for free](http://yourfirstiosapp.com).

If you like it, [you should go buy it](https://leanpub.com/your-first-ios-app/). Better yet, buy it, and then tell all your friends about it.

Sorry to be all pitchy, but I worked really hard on this and it'd be super-awesome if it made a big splash. And sorry for apologising â€“ I'm Canadian, after all.
