For the past five months, I've been working with my colleagues at Teehan+Lax on an app called [Krush](http://krush.com). I learnt a lot while helping to write the app, and I wanted to share some of those lessons with you.

To that end, I've written a [blog post](http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/krush-ios-architecture) on the T+L blog featuring four case studies about decisions we made. Take a read and let me know what you think.
