I've been meaning to write a post like this one for a while, and I'm glad someone else did it so I can just link to it, instead :)

Here's a [great writeup](http://edsancha.com/blog/2014/01/28/whats-in-my-iOS-toolbox.html) of tools that developers should be at least familiar with.

I'd add a few things:

- [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa)
- [Specta](https://github.com/specta/specta)
- [AppSee](http://www.appsee.com) (if you're into Analytics)
