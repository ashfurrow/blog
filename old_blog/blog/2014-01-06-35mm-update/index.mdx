title: 35mm Update

I'm sad to report that the Newsstand app I wrote, [35mm](http://35mm.io) is shutting down.

It's unfortunate that we did not get more traction in the app store. It's really no one's fault â€“ I think that the market really spoke on this one. People are wiling to put up with ads to see curated photography. We bet that they'd be willing to pay a buck a month to get rid of the ads, and we were wrong.

It's sad, but it's also the end of a rewarding jounrey where all of us, Tom, Debbie, and myself, learned a lot. I'm proud of what we accomplished together and always will be.

Onto bigger and better things.
