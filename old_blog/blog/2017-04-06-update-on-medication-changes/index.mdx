I've been open about my [recent changes to antidepressant medications](/blog/good-bad-days/) and I wanted to provide an update about how things are going. In a word: well. Things are going well. A lot better than they've gone in a long time, in fact. I attribute this improvement to a recent change in medication.


Depression saps energy from me. There are days I can't even get out of bed because it takes too much energy. What I miss most about _not_ having depression is the abundance of things to do. There were days in university where I would stay up all night configuring drivers for a hackintosh because I was just _so_ excited to do it. Or times in Toronto when I'd walk myself to exhaustion taking photos all day, I just couldn't stop. 

I miss feeling _compelled_ to do something: the ecstasy of borderline mania that accompanies me when I'm accomplishing something I have my heart set on.

Well lately I've been feeling a trickle of that energy. Not a lot, but more than, you know, none. I'm excited about the projects I get to work on at Artsy, I'm writing on this blog more I'm taking guitar lessons, I'm hosting an [OSS social network](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon/) for crying out loud.

For the first time in a while, the things I'm _excited_ to do exceed the number of hours I have to spend on them. I'm excited to play guitar, but also excited to write this blog post. I have to pick one, and here we are. 

Oddly enough, it's introducing some FOMO and I'm having a hard time dealing with that kind of anxiety. This is progress. Recovery isn't a straight line, and if my recouped energy leads me to a little anxiety around what to spend my time on, well then I'll have to deal with that. No problem.
