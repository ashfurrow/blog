Before I left Europe, I gave a talk at [dotSwift](http://www.dotswift.io), one of the first conferences focusing exclusively on Apple's new programming language. Well, the videos have bene posted, and I'm very happy with the results.

I'm very proud of this talk; I had planned and organized it weeks in advance, and I practice over and over. There are still some flaws with my delivery, but I'm very excited to have this as a new yardstick by which to measure my other presentations.

At under twenty minutes, it's fair short. If you want more details, I'm giving a more in-depth talk in [Istanbul](http://www.istanbultechtalks.com) next month.
