Today – Halloween – marks four years since my wife and I [returned to live in New Brunswick](/blog/moving-home-to-new-brunswick/). I feel compelled to reflect and share.

It feels disingenuous to say that things haven't gone as I expected them to, because I didn't really have explicit expectations. But I suppose it is accurate to say: my self in 2020 would be surprised with the way things have turned out.

Life since moving home has been complicated. I've felt loss. Sadness. Frustration.

Anger.

I don't like how certain events have played out, but I've learned to accept that - while I am only in control of myself - I _am_ in control of myself. I've learned not to assume responsibility for the feelings and actions of others. I've learned boundaries. [I've grown](/blog/new-year-new-me/). And I've had to accept that not everyone is interested in that growth.

I'm still figuring out who I am. And I do still catch myself thinking of "figuring out who I am" as a task that will someday be completed. That will someday become past tense, done. Checkmark. Instead, it is something that I do and then I keep doing and then one day I'll die. And only then will "figuring out who I am" be over. But it won't be done. It won't be accomplished.

[In 2021](/blog/what-happens-next/), I wrote about how my wife and I have largely gone where life has taken us. That has led to great adventures, but it has also carried great costs. When I wrote that in 2021, things _did_ feel different. But change is slow. We're more in the driver's seat of our own lives than ever before.

If I'm being honest, some days I feel like I've woken up from a long dream. I look around and I don't understand. Not confused, but I don't understand. Where am I? How did I get here?

Maybe this is middle life. Maybe. But it doesn't feel like a crisis – and after the last four years, I would know.

Four years in New Brunswick. The Picture Province! "Home." A place I can't seem to forgive.

A place to live. Because we chose to and because we continue to choose to.

Not a home that we take our place in. But a place to make our own home.
