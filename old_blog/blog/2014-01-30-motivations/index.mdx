It's worth revisiting [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t02iJn5Ypio#t=41m12s) from a few years ago where Eric Schmidt talks about the Ice Cream Sandwich release of Android.

His words merit repeating because, as we've seen over the past few years, app vendors are _not_ driven by volume alone, but are rather driven by the ability to make money. [As we've seen](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/11/27/apples-ios-brings-developers-5x-more-revenue-per-download-than-android), iOS is where the money is being had.
