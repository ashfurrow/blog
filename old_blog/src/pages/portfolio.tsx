      I started leading Artsy&apos;s Mobile Experience team in 2019, but my
      technical leadership spans back much further. Artsy encouraged to expand
      my impact so in 2015,{' '}
      <a href="/blog/building-online-communities/">
        I began learning about team dynamics
      </a>{' '}
      and applying what I learned in my team as an individual contributor. Over
      the years,{' '}
      <a href="/blog/perspective-of-the-polyglot/">
        I expanded my technical impact
      </a>{' '}
      by learning new systems and technologies, and{' '}
      <a href="/blog/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/">
        expanded my cultural impact
      </a>{' '}
      by learning how to foster healthy, empathetic, and productive work
      environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach to guiding product development centres learning as its goal.
      Developers build new products in complicated business contexts, and we
      don&apos;t know the answers upfront. I help teams learn <em>how</em> to
      solve the problem effectively and efficiently. We end up building a great
      product, but we do so by focusing on the <em>learning</em> rather than the{' '}
      <em>building</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This focus means creating a team environment where we are constantly
      learning and then teaching what we have learned, often across disciplines.
      This foundation of learning has helped me scale up Artsy&apos;s mobile
      software expertise across many product teams{' '}
      <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2020/09/29/becoming-mobile-first-at-artsy/">
        to become a genuinely mobile-first product organization
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      I excel at creating self-improving systems that distribute knowledge and
      responsibility across teams. At Artsy,{' '}
      <a href="https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/05/07/fully-automated-standups/">
        I gave away responsibility for the engineering-wide sync
      </a>
      . At Shopify, I built up our release management rotation so every shift
      made things easier for the next one.
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach to technical leadership keeps me hands-on. Sometimes I work
      out ahead of the team, prototyping new ideas or helping avoid upcoming
      problems. However, most of my work is leading from behind. My intuition
      tells me what needs to be done most and I make sure it gets done.

      Since I was a teenager, I&apos;ve been fascinated with open source
      software. Not just the software itself, but the communities surrounding
      different projects. No one individual can accomplish what a community can
      – people can always accomplish more if they work together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I practice a{' '}
      <a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/open-source-ideology/">
        fairly radical openness
      </a>
      : I believe that unless there is a good reason to keep something secret,
      then it should be shared. Artsy called it &ldquo;open source by
      default.&rdquo; Teehan+Lax called it &ldquo;creating more value than you
      capture.&rdquo; These phrases gave names to the ideas that have always
      resonated with me.

          My role as Senior Staff Developer gave me a broad mandate to improve
          our engineering organization and deliver product goals efficiently. I
          met regularly with company leadership to keep our technical efforts

          future where everyone is moved by art every day. I worked on a variety

          and eventually leading Artsy&apos;s Mobile Experience team.

          35mm was an ambitious project that I undertook with a team of two
          others: a designer and an editor. We aimed to change the world for
          photography-lovers by providing curated photography without
          advertisements. Although the project was not a success from a
          financial standpoint, I learned a lot about writing Newsstand

          Node.js.

          respond to customer support inquiries, all while continuing to ship an
          amazing product. I learned a lot about how software serves the needs
          of the business, and collaborating towards shared goals as a team. As
          a team lead, I played a crucial role in the design and development of
