## Server Setup

The site is served from [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). The feeds are served from the `feed.ashfurrow.com` subdomain (aliased to the main domain, except everything that's not a feed URL will 404). Currently, building the site exceeds Netlify's image constraints and has to be deployed locally:

```sh
yarn deploy # alias for yarn build && yarn deploy-built
```
