I've been reading a phenomenal book called [Design for Hackers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1119998956/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1119998956&linkCode=as2&tag=ashfur-20) by David Kadavy. I'm about halfway through the book and have been learning a lot – even just having things I already knew arranged in new ways. It's been a great experience.

I think that readers of this blog probably appreciate design more than the typical hacker. This book isn't about how to design things, but rather how to appreciate the design of things; it's not a tutorial on Photoshop, it's something a lot more special.

I'd highly recommend it.
