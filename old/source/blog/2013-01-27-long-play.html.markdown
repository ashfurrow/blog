My friend Adam Shutsa and I have been toying with the idea of an OS X app we'd like to build that lets you listen to albums entirely at once (ie: not select individual songs). The designs for it are below.

Neither of us have time to dedicate to a "heads down" development of this, and we're not really doing this for profit (just fun!), so we've made the decision to develop it in the open source community.

The project is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/AshFurrow/LongPlay) and there are a list of issues there, so if you like the project and want to lend a hand, dig in!

I'll be pecking away at it — there is not a target completion date or anything. This is just a fun experiment to see what we can come up with.
