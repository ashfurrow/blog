      <title>Building Better Software by Building Better Teams</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On March 16, 2018, I delivered the opening keynote for &lt;a href="http://appdevcon.nl"&gt;Appdevcon&lt;/a&gt;, which was titled &lt;em&gt;Building Better Software by Building Better Teams&lt;/em&gt;. Slides are &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/ashfurrow/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The video will be available at a later date, but this is important enough to write a blog post accompanying the talk. I&amp;rsquo;ll add the video to this post when it becomes available. In the mean time, this post serves as a kind of pseudo-transcript of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello! I’m Ash Furrow, and I’ve been writing iOS apps since 2009. I’ve also helped build business-critical systems in Swift, Objective-C, Node, Scala, Rails, React – all kinds of stuff. And today we’re going to talk about how we can build better software by building better teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two and a half years ago I wrote &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-online-communities/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; about building online communities. It was inspired by seeing a talk by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/searls"&gt;Justin Searls&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_-qV8waPVM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Social Coding Contract&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about online communities. That month I wrote &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-my-career/"&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt; about how the next step in my career was going to become a community-builder: someone who builds teams. I ran that idea by my manager at Artsy, and then by our CTO, and I had their full support. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began researching team dynamics, community structures, and online empathy. Part of my job became to learn about team building and apply it to Artsy.
I’m not an expert in this field, but I’ve focused the past two and a half years on learning how to build teams, online and in-person, both in open source and business contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started, I wrote the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;… believing in something isn’t enough to make it happen. It takes planning and consistent action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still learning, and I’m still working on these skills. And today, I’m really excited to share some of what I’ve learned with all of you. So let&amp;rsquo;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal today is to convince you that team building improves software quality, and to provide you with a vocabulary to discuss team quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="team-quality-affects-software-quality"&gt;Team Quality Affects Software Quality&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we discuss how to use the quality of a team to influence the quality of the software produced, we need to define the relationship between team quality and software quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s step back and think at a slightly higher level. Developers often think that software teams are unique or special among teams, but that&amp;rsquo;s not true from an organizational perspective. We tend to think that building software is unique among other types of work, that we have unique needs and distinct characteristics that mean that organizational behaviour principles don&amp;rsquo;t apply to us. But &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; type of worker is unique and &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; field has their own distinct way of working. We can acknowledge what makes building software unique while still looking to other fields for lessons in structuring teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s borrow observations of other types of teams and apply them to teams of software developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/professor.jpg" alt="Photo of Professor Amy Edmondson" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amy Edmondson is a professor of Leadership at Harvard Business School. She was studying medical teams in hospital settings in the 90&amp;rsquo;s, and wanted to establish a correlation between patient outcomes (post-operation complications, things that can be easily and objectively measured) with team quality. She initially hypothesized that teams that reported making the fewest mistakes would be the ones with the best patient outcomes, but was surprised to find the exact opposite: teams with better patient outcomes reported making &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigating further, she discovered that teams with poorer outcomes were reluctant to admit mistakes because they feared being humiliated or shamed by their peers. So mistakes were hidden. This prevented the team from learning from the mistake and preventing the same mistake from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, effective teams (with better patient outcomes) readily discussed their mistakes. That way, everyone was able to learn from them. They felt safe to ask questions and suggest ideas, too, without fear of being ridiculed. The team&amp;rsquo;s outcomes benefited greatly from the individuals&amp;rsquo; freedom from fear of humiliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her research led Professor Edmondson to a concept she named &amp;ldquo;psychological safety.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;ll get into what that means later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My point is that the relationships between team members (the quality of a medical team) had a direct and measurable impact on the quality of the team&amp;rsquo;s output (patient health). The medical staff who were comfortable admitting and reporting mistakes knew that they would not be ridiculed or judged for them, and so the whole team benefited from the learning opportunities of those mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can generalize a bit: just as the quality of the medical team affected the quality of patient outcomes, team quality &lt;em&gt;generally&lt;/em&gt; affects team outcomes. Since software teams are teams like any other, the quality of the software team is going to affect the quality software they produce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A junior developer thinks they see problem in the network layer of an app. It was written by a senior member of the team. Will they feel comfortable pointing it out to their team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A programmer at your startup is rushed by a deadline. They are exhausted and have started making mistakes. Will they feel comfortable getting the rest they need in order to keep your app from crashing during an investor pitch?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A designer sees a complex animation that’s been implemented incorrectly, breaking the visual metaphor of the whole app. There&amp;rsquo;s not enough time to re-implement it from scratch, will the designer approach the app developer and work together on a compromise for v1?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: I didn&amp;rsquo;t say so during my talk, but the developer in each of these examples was&amp;hellip; me!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prime directive&lt;/strong&gt; of this post is: everyone on your team assumes that everyone else on the team is doing their best work, given their circumstances. When you start from that shared understanding – that you&amp;rsquo;re all doing your best you can – you can foster a compassionate working environment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="compassion-facilitates-teamwork"&gt;Compassion Facilitates Teamwork&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffering is a normal and inevitable part of life. Since work is a part of life, suffering &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be a part of work, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But just because suffering is inevitable doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; suffering is inevitable. It can be avoided, and it can be minimized. Compassion is defined as the process of minimizing suffering. And in that sense, &amp;ldquo;compassion&amp;rdquo; is an optimization problem: to minimize suffering. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being compassionate in our teams is about &lt;em&gt;minimizing&lt;/em&gt; the suffering of our teammates (and ourselves!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimizing something – anything – is something developers specialize in. We optimize app launch times, memory footprints, scrolling performance, so we should approach compassionate work on those terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how does one minimize suffering? Well there are two main ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respond to suffering with respectful inquiry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anticipate suffering and avoid/minimize it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be really hard because it requires empathy, which is a skill that developers are not known for. But that&amp;rsquo;s only because we don&amp;rsquo;t practice those skills! Every programmer and every human being is capable of empathy; it is only a matter of practicing the skill until it becomes a habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theresa Wiseman, a nursing academic, conducted &lt;a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2648.1996.12213.x/full"&gt;a literature review&lt;/a&gt; of the study of empathy and concluded that empathy consists of four necessary components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing another person&amp;rsquo;s perspective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing another person&amp;rsquo;s feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staying non-judgemental about those thoughts and feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicating that you understand (in a non-judgemental way).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last one gets missed a lot. It is not enough to understand what a person is thinking, to understand what they&amp;rsquo;re feeling, and to stay non-judgemental. Empathy involves &lt;em&gt;communicating&lt;/em&gt; your understanding back to the other person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These individually are skills that you can practice. They are skills that I am still practicing, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responding to suffering&lt;/strong&gt; with empathy is done through &amp;ldquo;inquiry work&amp;rdquo;, and is difficult to get right. But, like empathy, it is a skill that you can develop.
When inquiring about a colleague&amp;rsquo;s suffering, stay respectful. Frame your inquiry around genuine concern and the prime directive. Remember: everyone assumes that everyone else is doing their best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a team member&amp;rsquo;s number of commits have dropped, will you inquire about potential suffering or leave them alone to face disciplinary action later on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If one team member harshly reviews another team member&amp;rsquo;s code in a pull request, will you inquire about why they were harsh or leave them alone, lowering the bar for tolerable behaviour on your team?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an open source developer expresses remorse about not fixing an bug sooner, will you inquire about why they feel bad (and remind them that open source developers are volunteers) or leave them alone to feel needlessly bad?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can all be difficult, and it is definitely easier to ignore these situations. In fact, it is tempting to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; inquire about suffering out of some misplaced sense of empathy. But if someone&amp;rsquo;s work performance has dropped, is it really better to ignore their suffering until the point that disciplinary action is required?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anticipating suffering&lt;/strong&gt; also involves empathy, but in a different way. We can&amp;rsquo;t inquire about how they&amp;rsquo;re feeling about an event that hasn&amp;rsquo;t occurred yet, so we have to use our intuition and empathy to construct and idea of what they &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; feel and think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you understand someone&amp;rsquo;s thoughts and feelings without judging them, you can begin to anticipate how events will affect them. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t know a person well, focus on the similarities you have with them to foster empathy. Are they working in a similar field? Are they at a similar career stage as you? Are they working in the same company? These similarities help you empathize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of a sprint is approaching. Will you investigate your teammates&amp;rsquo; wellbeing or leave them alone until after the sprint has failed to find out that they needed help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your team is switching from Swift to React Native, will you talk about a teammate&amp;rsquo;s possible apprehension around being left behind or leave them alone so they feel isolated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is going to be a change in team reporting structure, will you inquire about a colleague&amp;rsquo;s apprehension about a prospective change or leave them alone to find out via email and let their imaginations run wild?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compassion is an optimization problem: to minimize suffering. And we can do that through inquiry work when we notice suffering, and through anticipating suffering to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on from minimizing suffering, we come to another powerful tool of effective teams: feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback is a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleague says that &amp;ldquo;feedback is a gift.&amp;rdquo; When he first told me that, it changed how I thought about feedback. I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel grateful for the constructive feedback I was getting, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t giving adequately constructive feedback either. If I didn&amp;rsquo;t have something positive to say about a colleague&amp;rsquo;s work, I didn&amp;rsquo;t say anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still struggle with this. But I try to make sure the feedback I give is a gift worth receiving, and to listen to feedback I&amp;rsquo;m given as the gift that it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A useful framework for thinking about how to approach our colleagues when something is wrong is called &lt;a href="http://radicalcandor.com"&gt;Radical Candour&lt;/a&gt;, which is the name of a &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2HGYVaE"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; on the giving and receiving feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a graph with the vertical axis representing whether or not you care personally about a colleague, and the horizontal axis representing whether or not you’re willing to challenge the directly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/graph.png" alt="A graph depicting two axes, representing caring for colleagues vs whether or not you're willing to challenge them directly" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay so now we have four possibilities on our graph, but today I want to focus on the top area of the chart, the area where you care personally about the other person. If you don’t care about the person, then&amp;hellip; well I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; convince you about why you ought to care for your colleagues but I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for it right now. So let&amp;rsquo;s assume that you care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright let’s take a look at the top right corner, where you care and you’re willing to challenge directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This area is where radical candour lives. It’s when you care enough about a person to ask difficult questions, to share difficult feelings, and to have difficult conversations. It can be an uncomfortable place at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your instinct might be to avoid the difficulties of talking to someone about something uncomfortable. That would be the top left corner of our graph, where you care but you’re unwilling to challenge someone directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This area of the graph is called “ruinous empathy” because you care about someone but you’re unwilling to have difficult conversations. It really is ruinous: you think that by avoiding a difficult conversation you might be helping a person, but avoiding difficult conversations is only helping yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Side note: this is why I get so mad when people diminish non-technical skills as “soft” and imply they aren’t difficult – they are! These are all difficult conversations, but radical candour is a skill and habit you can get better at.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/graph_filled_in.png" alt="A graph depicting two axes, representing caring for colleagues vs whether or not you're willing to challenge them directly, with labelled quadrants for radical candour and ruinous empathy" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Psychological Safety is a really useful idea that is unfortunately being co-opted and misused by managers and CEOs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical definition of psychological safety is &amp;ldquo;a measure of the comfort of a team to take interpersonal risks”, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really mean anything unless you do a lot of reading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I like to think of psychological safety as &amp;quot;the degree to which your team feels safe learning from its mistakes.” A psychologically safe environment is one where people feel safe asking questions, pointing out and admitting mistakes, and take risks without fear of being ridiculed by their teammates. Only a psychologically safe team is able to examine and learn from their mistakes, without needlessly judging themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Picard management tip: If you never fail, you aren&amp;rsquo;t going boldly enough.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Picard Tips (@PicardTips) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PicardTips/status/970012685797556225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 3, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Every person makes mistakes, and every team makes mistakes. They happen, in every setting imaginable, even on high-stakes medical teams. Like suffering, we can try to avoid and minimize mistakes, but they are inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must must must learn to accept our mistakes and to discuss them. Only then – when your team is comfortable with their own mistakes – will your team be able to learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was researching this presentation, I read through the Artsy blog archive. Not the Artsy Engineering blog, but the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/artsy-blog"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life at Artsy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; blog. And I came across &lt;a href="https://medium.com/artsy-blog/open-sourcing-company-culture-at-artsy-79720cf235cc"&gt;this article on open sourcing our company culture&lt;/a&gt;, which I collaborated on in 2015, predating my research into team dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being open with your errors and identifying the insights gained can help others avoid the same blunders and keep your team on-track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have the vocabulary to describe compassionate and toxic workplaces, it&amp;rsquo;s remarkable to me how well this quote characterizes psychological safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psychological safe work environments are also places where asking questions is a normal and &lt;em&gt;expected&lt;/em&gt; part of work. Try to foster an environment of curiosity and learning by asking questions, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re a senior developer. If you&amp;rsquo;re only 99% sure you know the answer to a question, then ask it anyway. 99% isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By asking questions, you are signalling to the rest of the team that asking questions is normal, and expected of them. This is especially important for teams with junior developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to take ideas to their extremes, and fostering an environment focused on learning is an extreme that I embrace. More important than &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; your team builds is the &lt;em&gt;learning process&lt;/em&gt; of building it. Say that your team is building an app. You&amp;rsquo;ve never built that app before, right? So instead of focusing on building the app, focus on &lt;em&gt;learning how to build the app&lt;/em&gt; and the app itself will naturally follow. Because your teammates care more about learning than they do about being ridiculed for making a mistake or asking a question, you catch bugs faster. You identify bottlenecks sooner. You anticipate problems before they manifest themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember: you&amp;rsquo;re not just learning, you&amp;rsquo;re learning &lt;em&gt;as a team&lt;/em&gt;, so you benefit from &lt;em&gt;everyone&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding compassion, it is far, far better to extend compassion to someone who might take advantage of it than it is to withhold compassion from someone who might need it. Remember the prime directive: we&amp;rsquo;re all doing our best; start from that shared understanding and you can foster compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="teams-are-the-sum-of-teamwork"&gt;Teams are the Sum of Teamwork&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a really useful term for discussing team work, but before we get there I need to tell you about Buckminster Fuller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was an American architect, systems theorist, author, designer, and inventor. President of Mensa. Smart person. And in the 60&amp;rsquo;s and 70&amp;rsquo;s, Buckminster Fuller spoke at universities around the world and used that opportunity to popularize a word. The word described an enormously useful idea, and he was aghast that it didn&amp;rsquo;t catch on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the word did eventually catch on with opportunistic CEOs and product managers. It became overused and through overuse, the word became devalued. Unfortunately, when we devalued the word, we seem to have devalued the idea, too. And that word is&amp;hellip; &lt;strong&gt;synergy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synergy means behaviour of whole systems unpredicted by the behaviour of their parts taken separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also said: &amp;quot;there is nothing in the chemistry of a toenail that predicts the existence of a human being.” If you need a more technical example:there&amp;rsquo;s nothing in the mechanics of DNS that predicts the existence of the world wide web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synergy is essentially a word for the idea that a whole is larger than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s such a shame that &amp;quot;synergy&amp;rdquo; has fallen into disuse because this is a very useful idea, and it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to have a conversation about ideas without actually having a name for them. So: let&amp;rsquo;s bring &amp;ldquo;synergy&amp;rdquo; back! Let&amp;rsquo;s reclaim it from the waste bin of history. I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the word &amp;ldquo;synergy&amp;rdquo; unironically and I encourage you too as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/team.jpg" alt="A photo of Artsy staff a the Sotheby's Input/Output auction, October 2015" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a photo from 2015, taken at Artsy’s first ever &lt;a href="https://www.artsy.net/auction/input-output"&gt;art auction we ran with Sotheby’s&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest auction houses in the world. It was a huge deal – months of work had built up to this night. The future of the Artsy auctions business hinged on this event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were all there to ensure that the product we’d built together performed flawlessly. But there are only four engineers in this photo (one of them is the CTO). The rest are auction liaisons, marketers, support staff, project managers, and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think about how a typical software project is managed, it includes more than just programmers. Technology is the product, but the developers are only a part of that team. A programmer working by themselves would not produce a very compelling product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the responsibility of the team leaders to facilitate a team structure where the design team, the developer team, the support team, etc are appropriate aware of each other. Not everyone can be aware of what everyone else is doing; cross-team communication can easily become overwhelming, so it needs to be done with care and attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And indeed, this kind of synergy has business precedence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/sj.jpg" alt="A photo of Steve Jobs giving a keynote" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: I generally don’t like quoting Steve Jobs in conference presentations because it’s kind of cheating: we all know who he is and we are all familiar with his work. Many of us admire him. But what he has to say applies really well here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have many criticisms of how Steve Jobs managed teams, but he did get this right. He famously said:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s in Apple&amp;rsquo;s DNA that technology alone is not enough.  It’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields the results that make our hearts sing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wake up, people! He&amp;rsquo;s describing synergy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And he&amp;rsquo;s describing a &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; success that is only possible through cross-team collaboration, through knowledge-sharing. A diverse team of teams working towards a common, well-defined goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synergy can exist in any team, but I believe that it is fostered best in teams that exhibit psychological safety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can synergy look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Artsy, I helped run a month-long, once-weekly &lt;a href="http://artsy.github.io/series/swift-at-artsy/"&gt;course in Swift&lt;/a&gt;. We designed two tracks: one for people who could explain what &amp;ldquo;Object-Oriented Programming&amp;rdquo; means, and another for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We took care to foster an environment where our non-technical colleagues could learn about coding and ask questions about how programming works. As a result, we fostered a broader work environment where they felt comfortable asking questions. We increased the psychological safety of our team, gave our colleagues the vocabulary to ask even more interesting questions, and we have been rewarded by a better team. A team that feels comfortable asking questions about products &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they&amp;rsquo;re built, pointing out potential bugs &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; they get written, and contributing in ways we never anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Side note: it took a lot of composure not to tear up during this part of my presentation because I&amp;rsquo;m so proud of the work we&amp;rsquo;ve done and the work of my non-technical colleagues who took the time to learn more about how software gets built.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that humans are naturally empathetic. Any parent can tell you that when babies hear another infant crying out, they start crying out too. These infants are only a few days old and don&amp;rsquo;t have language skills, but they sympathize with other reflexively. This sympathetic crying is hardwired into our brains from birth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans are not Epicureans, driven solely by rational self-interest. I reject psychological egoism. Human beings are complex individuals driven not only by self-interest, but also driven by a fierce need to care for others. Humans are empathetic by nature and it is only when obstacles are erected in our path that we ignore this drive to care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Society erects social barriers that prevent us from caring for others. These barriers often manifest themselves as judgements we make about others. &amp;ldquo;That person on the street asking me for money should just get a job&amp;rdquo; is a judgement, and it shuts down our ability to care for that &lt;em&gt;person&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so too do workplaces erect barriers to caring, and so too do they manifest as judgements. We judge each other (and ourselves) whenever we use the word &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iOS developers &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; use Swift instead of Objective-C.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;React Native developers &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; just learn a real language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designers &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; just learn to code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these judgements shut down our ability to empathize, to care, and to be compassionate. And we see violations of our prime directive: to assume that everyone is doing the best they can, given their circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One really common form of these barriers manifesting themselves on software team is what people call &amp;ldquo;brutal honesty.&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s this idea that as long as what you&amp;rsquo;re saying is true, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how you say it. In fact, how you say something matters just as much as what you&amp;rsquo;re saying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Quick note: your brutal honesty? Ain&amp;rsquo;t nobody asking for that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Where is you clever honesty? Your compassionate honesty? Your insightful honesty? Uplifting? Poetic? Empowering?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take your brutal honesty and go sit in the back with all the devil&amp;rsquo;s advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Quinn Murphy (@qh_murphy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/qh_murphy/status/956321955778650112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 25, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Compassionate honesty. What an amazing idea! A form of honesty that tries to minimize suffering. Radical candour doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you have to hurt someone&amp;rsquo;s feelings to tell them a truth – radical candour is only radical because you care, so make sure that your honesty conveys that sense of caring for others.
Synergy is when a group behaves in a way not predicted by the behaviour of its constituent components. We foster synergy in software teams by being compassionate, by caring for each other, by staying non-judgemental. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Code is never the challenge. Well-rested comfortable people who feel emotionally safe have solved every problem I’ve put in front of them.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; C J Silverio can deadlift you (@ceejbot) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ceejbot/status/761569569802551300?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of obstacles, humans &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We foster synergy through psychological safety, and we recognize that humans will care for one another &lt;em&gt;by default&lt;/em&gt; if unimpeded by their environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about a lot today. Starting with the connection between team quality and team outcomes, we discussed compassion in the workplace: what it looks like and how to foster it. And we concluded with a discussion of synergy. (I hope you all start using that word!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spent the past two and half years learning about this stuff, and I’m definitely not done. But I&amp;rsquo;d like to offer a jump-start on your own journeys: I have some recommended reading for you. This is not an exhaustive list, of course, but these are resources that I have found useful in my own path to learning about compassion at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is a book, &lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2DyJwqo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Awakening Compassion at Work&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent book that puts the business case forward for compassion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://compassionatecoding.com"&gt;Compassionate Coding&lt;/a&gt;, a firm run by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aprilwensel"&gt;April Wensel&lt;/a&gt;, which helps companies build compassionate teams. Check out &lt;a href="https://medium.com/compassionate-coding"&gt;their blog&lt;/a&gt; for sure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://amzn.to/2pkvGD3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a book by Buckminster Fuller. It is a collection of steps that humanity needs to take if we are to survive the 21st century. It profoundly changed the way I think about systems generally, including teams.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://write.danilocampos.com/inclusion-is-a-captains-job-5c433726bd33"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inclusion is a Captain’s Job&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_danilo"&gt;Danilo Campos&lt;/a&gt; is a conference talk-turn-blog post about lessons of inclusion from the Star Trek cannon. The &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; Star Trek cannon. And he 100% presented the talk in a Starfleet Engineering uniform:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/danilo.jpg" alt="A photo of Danilo Campos giving a presentation while wearing a Starfleet Engineering uniform" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we&amp;rsquo;re at the end of this post, I have something really important to tell you&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will never finish.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will never finish working towards compassion. Your education in compassion, your pursuit of building better teams, will last the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;critical&lt;/em&gt; to remember this. Us engineers are used to thinking about tasks in terms of GitHub issues to be closed or Trello cards to move to the “Done” column, but building compassionate teams is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; something you can ever call &amp;ldquo;finished.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must accept the fact that your work will never &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; be complete, and you must commit yourself to the pursuit of the shared compassion of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mood Improvements</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mood-improvements/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay so it&amp;rsquo;s been over a month since I &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/progress-and-pianos/"&gt;last checked in&lt;/a&gt; about how my mood was doing. It&amp;rsquo;s better! But I have this habit of believing that everything is improving because I feel good &lt;em&gt;at the moment&lt;/em&gt;, despite continued problems in my mood. So I&amp;rsquo;ll go to my psychiatrist and she&amp;rsquo;ll say &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rsquo;ve you been this week?&amp;rdquo; and I&amp;rsquo;ll say &amp;ldquo;great!&amp;rdquo; because I feel good &lt;em&gt;at that moment&lt;/em&gt;, and it prevents me from acknowledging the problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this time, I have data! My friend Felix wrote a &lt;a href="https://github.com/KrauseFx/mood"&gt;small Telegram app&lt;/a&gt; that texts you three times a day to ask how you&amp;rsquo;re feeling. Nice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/mood-improvements/screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of the app I'm using to track my mood" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been particularly keen to see the data over the past week, since I just today have my second weekly session with a new therapist. Last Friday, she gave me some exercises to practice my observation skills, and encouraged me to begin meditating again. With the help of &lt;a href="https://www.headspace.com"&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meditating twice a day: once in the morning and once in mid-afternoon in Artsy&amp;rsquo;s meditation room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay so on to the data. I started collecting it just over a month ago, so I&amp;rsquo;ve got a few weeks before starting therapy and meditation, and a week afterwards. I&amp;rsquo;ve marked on the image below when I started, and the data is available in plaintext format &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/ashfurrow/752aab4da069076ad893a88cc2a983a0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for people with visual impairments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/mood-improvements/mood.png" alt="A graph of my mood over the past month" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Okay, nice. So things were pretty turbulent there before begining therapy. Mostly bouncing around 3 (good, alright) and (down, worried). There are three dips down to 0 (miserable, nervous), which represent, uh, very very bad moods where I felt at my lowest. With all that is implied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But hey look! For the past week, my mood has been almost entirely 3 (good, alright) or 4 (happy, excited)! Awesome news. I finally feel like things might be improving &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; I have the data to back up that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to track your mood with software, you have a few options. There&amp;rsquo;s the app I&amp;rsquo;m using that I linked to earlier, as well as &lt;a href="https://expo.io/@kkemple/hwyd"&gt;HWYD&lt;/a&gt;, detailed in &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@kurtiskemple/introducing-hwyd-an-app-for-graphing-depression-442a508c2016"&gt;this awesome blog post&lt;/a&gt; and is &lt;a href="https://github.com/kkemple/hwyd"&gt;also open source&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Progress and Pianos</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/progress-and-pianos/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For over a year now, I have been &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/learning-guitar/"&gt;learning guitar&lt;/a&gt;. And it&amp;rsquo;s been going great, but also not great. I enjoy guitar, but I am still very much &lt;em&gt;learning&lt;/em&gt; guitar. I&amp;rsquo;m not proficient in the styles I want to be. And, I have plateaued. There are songs I listen to, &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to learn, but can&amp;rsquo;t. Not because the songs are too advanced, but because of &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/proprioception/"&gt;struggling&lt;/a&gt; with depression since September, which contributes to the rut I find myself in on guitar. Depression has a way of magnifying challenges, and so the challenges of mastering the skills necessary to learn new songs are magnified. Moreover, the &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt; of learning is mostly lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily I&amp;rsquo;m improving! I really am, things are better and still improving – but after a few months of this kind of avoidance, one naturally develops habits. I got in the &lt;em&gt;habit&lt;/em&gt; of avoiding guitar, which is now something I need to break. But, once again, that&amp;rsquo;s a challenge that is being magnified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For as long as the Artsy Auctions team has existed, we have talked about getting a piano for the office. Not a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; piano of course, a digital one. One with nice weighted keys. We could pool our money and spend – maybe $500? – on a piano, connect some headphones so only the player will hear it, and put it somewhere in the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How nice would it be to have a piano just &lt;em&gt;available&lt;/em&gt; at the office? Stuck on a problem? Frustrated with something? Bored at lunch? Step away for a few minutes&amp;hellip; 𝓉𝑜 𝓉𝒽𝑒 𝓅𝒾𝒶𝓃𝑜.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about it for well over a year, when last fall I finally took action on it. Pooling money and buying the piano is the easy part; the biggest dependency of my &lt;em&gt;Office Piano&lt;/em&gt; OmniFocus project was &lt;em&gt;Get Permission from Ops&lt;/em&gt;. Does Artsy have enough space in the office? Will we &lt;em&gt;continue&lt;/em&gt; to have enough space? Where will it go? Will it be disruptive to Artsy colleagues? I scouted out some prospective locations for the piano, considered logistics, and sent a proposal to Artsy&amp;rsquo;s Ops team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took some time to get a response, but eventually they gave us tentative permission! Ops were very open to the idea in principle, but naturally had some questions. We went back and forth over Slack for weeks before I happened to bump into a colleague on the Ops team. I asked about the state of their team&amp;rsquo;s discussion about the piano and, turns out, the Ops team was busy opening Artsy&amp;rsquo;s new London office, so (duh!) they were pretty busy. The piano just hadn&amp;rsquo;t been top-of-discussion while the team was split across continents. Even still, by talking with my colleague for two minutes we clarified all of the outstanding details. Face-to-face had accomplished in minutes what weeks of Slack could not in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017 ended with a note from the colleague I&amp;rsquo;d briefly chatted with. Ops had officially given the thumbs-up on our office piano plan! The rest was up to us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably don&amp;rsquo;t know this about me because it&amp;rsquo;s never been a part of my adult life, but I played piano &lt;em&gt;daily&lt;/em&gt; from ages 11 to 18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to ask my parents, repeatedly and for what felt like forever, to get a piano. Piano&amp;rsquo;s aren&amp;rsquo;t exactly cheap, or even easy to actually buy. And so, I was given a&amp;hellip; well, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what they were called but I thought of them as tests. These were characteristic of my childhood: demonstrate the responsibility necessary to earn a privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids in the fifth grade of my elementary school all learn the recorder together, and my parents bought me lessons from a good family friend and neighbour, &lt;a href="http://thedowntownbluesband.com/bios/index.html#lloydbragdon"&gt;Lloyd&lt;/a&gt;. He ran a music store out of his garage across the road and he was my first formal music teacher. Lloyd was key to my entire musical education, but especially so in grade five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the school year, I &lt;em&gt;excelled&lt;/em&gt; at playing recorder. I mean, today at the age of 29 I have some doubts about my memories of being a child who was &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; at recorder. But importantly, I had rapidly developed an understanding of music&amp;rsquo;s most important fundamentals: notation, basic theory, rhythm, sub-dividing measures. I could sight-read. And I utterly &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; playing recorder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents were convinced. Lloyd helped them buy an affordable upright piano. Then he tuned it for us and put me in touch with his relative, Marie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marie quickly became a mentor and friend. A talented musician and gentle teacher, she played organ at a church down the road and taught piano lessons after school. She emphasized form, technique, feeling. She demanded proper posture and wrist position (and keeping fingernails short). She lent me sci-fi novels like &lt;em&gt;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;. When I was thirteen and terrified in the weeks following 9/11, Marie was the one I turned to for help dealing with my anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under her guidance, I prepared for the town&amp;rsquo;s annual music festival. I swept up in every category I competed in. Not really fair, an eleven year-old competing against six year-olds. (We had all been playing for less than a year, but still. The rules were changed the next year to adjudicate participants against a &lt;em&gt;rubric&lt;/em&gt; instead of against &lt;em&gt;each other&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was invited to play in the festival&amp;rsquo;s closing concert, on both piano and alto saxophone (I had joined the school band to learn it and had taken supplementary lessons from Lloyd).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year, I looked forward to the music festival. My parents still boast that they never had to tell me to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After graduating, I left my home town to go to university. I lost my musical support network. I lost my routine. I lost my free time. I stopped playing music. For a decade, until 2017 when I bought a ukulele, and then guitar, and now&amp;hellip; the office piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendees would start trickling in soon. I had less than a half hour before &lt;a href="http://peerlab.community"&gt;peer lab&lt;/a&gt; started, so I had to hurry getting set up. I&amp;rsquo;d already printed off &lt;a href="https://musescore.com/user/3471/scores/1352881"&gt;sheet music&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Entertainer&lt;/em&gt;, a ragtime jazz song I had memorized in grade 8. I wanted my re-introduction to piano to be gentle. I was nervous, but excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sit down. I begin, slow at first. Then faster. Then I blink. I look down at my watch: a half hour had passed. How could a half hour had already passed? I had to stop, it was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I was there for peer lab this morning and snuck away for about a half hour of piano. Had some trouble remembering the bass clef notation, but it came back to me pretty quickly! I am excited.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; The SI Unit Respecter (@ashfurrow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/954809752239865858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week went by. I got three more, quick sessions in on the piano and I was amazed by how much I remembered. I had bought some sheet music books of popular songs for the office. I picked &lt;em&gt;The Piano Man&lt;/em&gt; by Billy Joel and started sight-reading it – slow at first, then fster. I felt exhilarated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Other things they’ve helped:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- staying off twitter at work, unless it’s to complain about work&lt;br&gt;- getting to the office by 9:00, and forcing myself to leave at 5:00&lt;br&gt;- motivation: I’m leading a well-defined and interesting project, an internal tool to help out my colleagues&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; The SI Unit Respecter (@ashfurrow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/956666738933936128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 25, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to have a better work/life balance in 2018, and part of that is getting to and leaving the office at strict times. That goal is orthogonal to my desire to immerse myself in playing piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see where this is going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apartments in Manhattan&amp;rsquo;s East Village are tiny. So, a piano. How does that even fit? I didn&amp;rsquo;t see any space in our room (singular). I talked to Ashley and told her how important this was to me, and she wasted no time helping me figure out where a piano could go in our apartment. We spent the weekend rearranging and doing some general spring-cleaning to cut-down on stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m glad I have a supportive partner. She&amp;rsquo;s excited to get to know this part of me for the first time. Our piano arrives on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s about to happen, but for the first time since August, I feel like things are about to &lt;em&gt;improve&lt;/em&gt;. Like, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve felt &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; was going to improve; best-case scenario was things only stayed as bad as they are. And today, something is changed. I feel optimistic again. And I intend to capitalize on that optimism: through therapy, I have learned to fold improvements in my mood back in on themselves. Feedback loops. The virtuous complement to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuous_circle_and_vicious_circle"&gt;vicious circles&lt;/a&gt; I had experienced with depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medication changes I started two months ago have finally stabilized, and have brought me back to the frame of mind I had in August: ready to turn the page on this depressive chapter of my life and move forward. It&amp;rsquo;s ironic that I&amp;rsquo;m looking to something from my past, music, in order to move forward. But we live in ironic times!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Earth: Final Conflict</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/earth-final-conflict/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What I love about art, and mass media in particular, is how it is shaped by the time and place it was created. Looking at a movie or TV show from 20 years ago, you can get a glimpse into how the world was back then, and reflect on how things have changed. In my opinion, there is no genre better-suited than science fiction for this lens because sci-fi itself is all about asking &amp;ldquo;what if?&amp;rdquo;, and the questions a society asks are as revealing as the answers they come up with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was on a roll the other morning, talking about old sci-fi shows I&amp;rsquo;d watched. I mentioned one that I&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss today: &lt;em&gt;Gene Roddenberry&amp;rsquo;s Earth: Final Conflict&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Earth: Final Conflict is really good at examining the implications of radical technological advancement, the secondary implications, the tertiary ones, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like how does FTL travel affect your commute to work? That kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Person who tells you to write more blog posts (@ashfurrow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/952949071911800837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 15, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earth: Final Conflict&lt;/em&gt; hit TV in the late nineties, and I watched it via Canadian TV syndication during my early teenage years. The show tells the story of humanity, set roughly in the 2020&amp;rsquo;s, who are visited by ostensibly peaceful aliens (called &amp;ldquo;companions&amp;rdquo;, the show is full of poignant euphemisms). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The show has lots of great storylines like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would humans graft alien tech onto our own tech? How would that affect our day-to-day lives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who would resist the companions? Why? How?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if a companion, too evolved to normally interact in the corporeal realm, developed a drug addiction?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend the show is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;, but I enjoy how it answers these questions. We&amp;rsquo;re not here to discuss the show, though, but rather what it reveals to us about the time it was created. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, the late nineties. Computers were cool, and obviously important, but the general population didn&amp;rsquo;t understand computers or the internet in the way they do today. So, the show gets some things right (everyone on the show has a &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://earthfinalconflict.wikia.com/wiki/Global"&gt;global&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, which is a video-conferencing device, but it&amp;rsquo;s also on the internet, has a camera, and is basically a contemporary smartphone).  But the show also gets some things wrong (like any time they actually &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; a computer, it&amp;rsquo;s farcical).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/earth-final-conflict/global.jpg" alt="A global, a communication device on the show" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to draw your attention to S04E05, &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0568689/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherlode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, released October 2000. The plot of the episode, like most episodes of &lt;em&gt;Earth: Final Conflict&lt;/em&gt;, is not its strong suit. Rather, it&amp;rsquo;s the questions it asks and how it answers them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See, the companions (officially) arrived on Earth at the end of a brutal world conflict, which nearly ended in a nuclear holocaust. Mediated by the newfound companions, a peace armistice was negotiated to end the Sino-Indian War. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherlode&lt;/em&gt; asks the question: what if a black ops organization took advantage of everyone being distracted by the arrival of the companions, and worked in secret to massively expand its sphere of influence via the Sino-Indian War Measures Act?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The episode begins with two hooded, chained figures being escorted by armed guards. It&amp;rsquo;s dark. A man in a suit tells them to listen up: by the powers granted by the SI War Measures Act, his company was suspending their civil rights. They are to be detained, indefinitely, in his sensory deprivation prison. Submerged in breathable, body-temperature water, they will be deprived of all sensory stimulation. Forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/earth-final-conflict/sendep.jpg" alt="A character we know about to be lowered into a sensory deprivation prison tank" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a fucking &lt;em&gt;mad&lt;/em&gt; premise. Like, fuuuuuuuuck. That&amp;rsquo;s dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole show makes a point of exploring why the SI War Measures Act wasn&amp;rsquo;t repealed with the armistice, what factors are stopping it from being repealed now, and most importantly, the episode makes the following point: the evil of the secret sensory deprivation prison system is something that humans are inflicting on &lt;em&gt;themselves&lt;/em&gt;. Usually in the show, it&amp;rsquo;s the companions who hurt humanity, but this episode is different. It depicts the (wildly fictional) idea of a society run by a government that doesn&amp;rsquo;t respect its citizens rights, one who is unaccountable to its citizens. There are several instances of psychological torture. It&amp;rsquo;s not an easy episode to watch. And as I said, this episode aired eleven months before the attacks of 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question &amp;ldquo;what if black ops sendep prisons?&amp;rdquo; is answered by &amp;ldquo;humanity would torture each other, vindictively and relentlessly&amp;rdquo;, which is a pretty chilling-but-accurate answer. It shocked me how much our perception of the United Stats has changed in just seventeen years. In 2000, the idea that the US intelligence community would be running secret torture prisons without any oversight was a chilling sci-fi &amp;ldquo;what if&amp;rdquo;, but in 2018 it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; reality? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, I know I know, the US has a much longer history of fucking with people and trampling their rights domestically and abroad, &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt;. The difference is: everyone I know today accepts this as reality, but in 2000, abuse of a war measures act seemed purely hypothetical. &lt;em&gt;How we perceive&lt;/em&gt; the world has shifted so much, so quickly. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s always been the case, maybe things always move this fast. But re-watching this episode, it disturbed me deeply to be reminded of what the world felt like when I watched as a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I look at the new &lt;em&gt;Star Trek Discovery&lt;/em&gt; and I feel like a really strong 2003-era fascist vibe. Pro-government, mindlessly pro-war and pro-aggression. Humanity at its worst. Art, and specifically mass media, are a reflection of our hopes and fears. What does the media that&amp;rsquo;s being produced today say about us? Nothing good.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gridcoin</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/gridcoin/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve known about bitcoin since 2012 when a friend described a kind of digital currency that he purchased by meeting a guy at a subway station and exchanging an envelope of cash for an envelope of a hard drive. The whole concept felt as something not very above-board. So I decided not to learn more about it and just generally ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years passed when I would catch the occasional headline describing the currency&amp;rsquo;s latest record-setting price, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t pay it much attention until I moved in New York. Bitcoin would come up in conversation at Artsy; people were discussing new art projects and new technologies and new startups centred around blockchains. And so, cryptocurrency reasserted itself within my bubble and I took a closer look. That was about 18 months ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading articles and watching videos – and listening to a great lunchtime presentation from a colleague – I now have a solid grasp on the technical underpinnings of the different technologies involved in bitcoin. I have a less solid understanding of some of the practical nuances, but I&amp;rsquo;ve got the technical stuff down. Cryptography, mining, P2P networks for blockchains, that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m reading headlines about new record-setting bitcoin prices with the perspective of the technological underpinnings. And I still wasn&amp;rsquo;t impressed. I mean, the technology is &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt;, but I&amp;rsquo;m not excited about the idea of a bunch of powerful nerds getting rich. Amazing tech, but not something I want to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then a few months ago, I noticed an uptick in media coverage about bitcoin. Articles like &lt;a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ywbbpm/bitcoin-mining-electricity-consumption-ethereum-energy-climate-change"&gt;this one exploring bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s carbon footprint&lt;/a&gt; were being discussed at the office. Bitcoin was being increasingly reported on by people who understood it, leading to more critical coverage and more reporting targeted at a non-engineering audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good! But I still kind of dismissed it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have anything to do with it, and I still don&amp;rsquo;t. Sadly, I may have thrown the proverbial baby out with the bathwater; the blockchain technology that bitcoin is built upon is &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; interesting. I learnt more about etherium and the distributed-computing infrastructure it&amp;rsquo;s built upon and – yeah I regretted not buying bitcoin when it was under $10 – I threw $150 into etherium. I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; etherium and I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;m now involved with cryptocurrencies, yet here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things changed a few weeks ago when, during follow-up on their episode about citizen science, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/izqaWyZsEtY?t=784"&gt;PBS Spacetime mentions a cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; gridcoin, which you mine by devoting computing cycles to BOINC research programs. Seems a bit more useful than bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s useless cryptographic calculations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gridcoin.us"&gt;Gridcoin&lt;/a&gt;, eh? &lt;a href="https://boinc.berkeley.edu"&gt;BOINC&lt;/a&gt;, huh? Let&amp;rsquo;s check this out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did, and through capitalizing on my newly rediscovered interesting in tinkering on things, I revived my Raspberry Pi and set off. Over the course of the past two weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about gridcoin and playing with the related technologies. And while I have a good theoretical understanding of cryptocurrency technologies, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the experience of working with cryptocurrencies in practice. The past few weeks have therefore been a lot of learning new ideas and refining new skills.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/gridcoin/pi.png" alt="BOINC on a Raspberry Pi" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s back up and define gridcoin. Other cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, are mined by computers that compete to solve cryptographic hash functions. That computing power is wasted, in a very real sense: solving those hashes isn&amp;rsquo;t useful &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; to mining more bitcoins. On the other hand, gridcoin is a cryptocurrency mined using calculations that contribute towards scientific research. In fact, gridcoin is really just a layer on top of BOINC, which predates bitcoin and blockchains altogether. This was something I could be interested in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOINC is a project run out of Berkley; it administers work to a network of distributed computers owned by ordinary people, who volunteer their spare computing resources to BOINC. This is really important because many projects in science require a lot of computing power. Furthermore, many of these projects lend themselves to being solved using BOINC&amp;rsquo;s distributed batch-processing architecture. You may be familiar with its most famous project &lt;a href="http://setiathome.berkeley.edu"&gt;SETI@Home&lt;/a&gt;, the search for extraterrestrial life, but there are others. My favourites include &lt;a href="https://sech.me/boinc/Amicable/"&gt;Amicable Numbers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://milkyway.cs.rpi.edu/milkyway/"&gt;Milkyway@Home&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://asteroidsathome.net"&gt;Asteroids@Home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So gridcoin basically piggy-backs off of the existing credit and team systems built into BOINC. A blockchain is used to keep track of transactions, like other cryptocurrencies, but new coins are staked based off your contributions to BOINC projects. I&amp;rsquo;m still learning the nuances of the somewhat confusing math, but the general idea is that the more you contribute towards a project&amp;rsquo;s work units (relative to how much others have contributed, and some other factors), the more gridcoins you stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Despite a very active community, I found the documentation to be difficult to follow and sometimes out of date. The guides and wikis I found mostly assumed you already knew what you were doing. Maybe when I have a better grasp of it all, I&amp;rsquo;ll return to update the docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve installed the BOINC client on my laptop and my pi, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been messing around on EC2 to spin up cloud servers to crunch numbers for SETI. It&amp;rsquo;s been fun, to tinker. I eventually settled on just using my laptop because even a c4.xlarge instance (4 virtual CPUs, $0.20/hour) performs worse than my laptop in terms of BOINC stats. I looked into GPU-specific instances, but cloud-based GPU access is still new and in high-demand, so it was too expensive for me (you can add a GPU to an EC2 instance for $0.50/hour, or rent a GPU-optimized instance starting from $0.90/hour). So yeah, not my thing! That&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One stumbling block I&amp;rsquo;ve faced when starting has been that (for reasons that are still beyond me) you need to &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; gridcoins to stake them. Seems kinda scam-y, but there&amp;rsquo;s a small transaction fee to basically announce yourself on the blockchain. Okay, fine, but also: when and how often you stake gridcoins (get credit for your BOINC work) is determined in part by how many gridcoins you already have. So starting out is tricky, feels weird, and involves a lot of waiting. With a balance of 3 gridcoins (which I acquired by signing up for a newsletter, lol), my estimated time-to-stake was an estimated three thousands days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/gridcoin/wallet.png" alt="Gridcoin wallet" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mmm. Mmhmmm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To build up an initial balance, I tried using a &lt;a href="https://grcpool.com"&gt;gridcoin pool&lt;/a&gt; on an EC2 instance for a few days but wasn&amp;rsquo;t really impressed. Using a pool is like solo mining except you don&amp;rsquo;t need the upfront investment (and you don&amp;rsquo;t get to keep all your earnings). Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m impatient – the calculations take longevity of contribution into account, and I only ran this server for like two days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/gridcoin/ec2.png" alt="BOINC on EC2" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(Lest my command-line hacker skills be called into question, yes I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; install a desktop environment on EC2 but I didn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to, it was just easier.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of paying per-second for anything. It reminded me I&amp;rsquo;m literally playing with money, and something about my upbringing makes that uncomfortable for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://ashfurrow.com/img/blog/gridcoin/pool.png" alt="EC2 gridcoin pool overview page" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I moved a bit of my etherium to my gridcoin wallet to prime the process. My time-to-stake estimate is now bouncing between 15–30 days. More reasonable I guess? I&amp;rsquo;ll learn to be patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways. Still don&amp;rsquo;t love that I&amp;rsquo;m doing this but it&amp;rsquo;s fun and I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying all the tinkering, so. Learning new things has been fun but (as usual) includes its share of frustrations too. And helping to map the galaxy just makes me feel warm and fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Who is Tom Scharpling?</title>
      <link>https://ashfurrow.com/blog/who-is-tom-scharpling/</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So a few weeks ago, I was listening to my new favourite Podcast &lt;a href="https://soundcloud.com/whatatimepod"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What a Time to Be Alive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the hosts mentioned a different show. This Tom Scharpling guy apparently has a show and they revered it a bit actually. The name sounded kinda familiar and I made a note to check him out later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well so this Tom fella is listed in the Apple Podcasts as running &lt;a href="http://thebestshow.net"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so I checked it out. About&amp;hellip; thirty seconds into the first episode I froze. My eyes dilated and defocused. I held my breath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Wait a minute.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I double-checked on IMDb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom Scharpling is the voice actor behind my favourite character on my &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/so-steven-universe-eh/"&gt;favourite show&lt;/a&gt;: Greg Universe. I&amp;rsquo;ve already been listening to this guy and I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it! And he was a writer and producer on &lt;em&gt;Monk&lt;/em&gt;, which played a big role in my formative years. (I&amp;rsquo;d never seen a protagonist depicted with a mental illness before.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay so that&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool, right? Well I kept reading up on him and he&amp;rsquo;s been involved with a bunch of musicians that I like, over many years. Very cool! I kept digging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Best_Show_with_Tom_Scharpling"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Show&lt;/em&gt; has been running&lt;/a&gt; for well over a decade, with many people now attributing the rise of podcasting &lt;em&gt;in general&lt;/em&gt; to this show. Some describe him as the &amp;ldquo;Godfather Of Podcasting&amp;rdquo;, according to &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Scharpling"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;. Very cool! I&amp;rsquo;ve run a number of podcasts over the years and they&amp;rsquo;ve all be influential on my career. My first was just with &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/my-podcast-loves-me/"&gt;some friends and colleagues in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, but I later did an &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/springboard/"&gt;interview series&lt;/a&gt; with established developers who described their origin stories – because we all start from somewhere – and finally I did &lt;a href="https://ashfurrow.com/blog/notification-center/"&gt;another iOS news show&lt;/a&gt;. (All the shows are defunct and offline, sorry. Welllll, one of them &lt;a href="http://notificationcenter.ashfurrow.com"&gt;is archived&lt;/a&gt; but you should absolutely not listen to it.) The point is, I probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have gotten into podcasting if not for the zeitgeist around the medium in 2011, which Tom Scharpling helped create.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this person, who I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know about really, has been influencing my life for well over a decade. My personal life, my career, my art. Wow. And I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know his name. Prettttty cool!&lt;/p&gt;
