<p>I love sharing knowledge – in the form of blog posts, podcasts, open source code, books – and over the past few years, I've grown really fond of speaking. I've gotten good at it, too.</p>

<p>Usually I like to deliver a combination of technical knowledge and inspirational messages. Context for technical know-how is critical. Understanding <em>what</em> you're doing is pointless if you don't understand <em>why</em> you're doing it.</p>
