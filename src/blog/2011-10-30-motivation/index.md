Don't use money to motivate yourself. If I don't enjoy a freelance project, it's probably not getting done. I've got a project right now that I enjoyed doing, and I've been paid for. That payment included a few bug fixes, which I now have to do. I've been fixing them and sending the product back to the client, who finds another bug, and sends it back. Right now, my motivation is keeping my inbox empty so I can focus on my work at 500px. I'm doing testing for the client, which I hate doing, because I'm motivated to.

Funny how motivation works.
