[Interesting read](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org) about reactive programming. More to do with server-side stuff, but still interesting. It's a little long, but even reading just "The Need to Go Reactive" section is worth your while if you've ever wondered about ReactiveCocoa.

Hat tip to [Alessandro Zoffoli](http://twitter.com/AL333Z).
