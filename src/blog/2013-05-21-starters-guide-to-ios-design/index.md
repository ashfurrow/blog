I just read an [interesting and thorough guide to iOS Design](http://taybenlor.com/2013/05/21/designing-for-ios.html) â€“ it's well worth checking out. It's a very concise distillation of Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/Introduction/Introduction.html) with fantastic graphics illustrating the different points it makes.

Definitely something to keep in your bookmarks folder as a quick reference.
