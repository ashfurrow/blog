When I lived in Amsterdam, a friend ran a weekly meetup for programmers. He held it on Saturday mornings, to discourage people who only had ideas for apps. The idea was to spend time in a café working on projects around other coders who were working on their projects, to exchange ideas and make connections. I enjoyed the Peer Lab so much that [I started my own](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab/) when I moved to New York and [ran it for five years](/blog/5-years-of-peer-lab/). It was only stopped by the novel coronavirus pandemic.

I made a lot of friends and acquaintances at these meetups. Lots of great memories, lots of fun coding.

Eventually, I created a website called _Peer Lab Community_ and hosted it at `peerlab.community`. It had a list of dozens of worldwide Peer Labs and instructions to start one of your own. I've maintained that site and domain until recently; I've decided to shut it down and let the domain expire next month. This is more of a formality than an actual change, since the list is woefully outdated. All of the events predate the pandemic and the only pull requests I've received in five years have be to remove events. I don't live in a big city (or travel frequently) like I used to, so I can't spread the idea around like I once did.

[The GitHub repo is archived](https://github.com/ashfurrow/peerlab.community) and the site content is still served at [ashfurrow.github.io/peerlab.community/](https://ashfurrow.github.io/peerlab.community/). The old URL will 301 redirect to the new archive, but only over HTTP.

It's sad to see it go, but I didn't want it to slip away unremarked upon.
