A few months ago, I [started a new job](/blog/new-job) at [Artsy](https://artsy.net). Artsy is based in New York and I've been working remotely from Amsterdam.

We took advantage of me being in America for WWDC to have me come to New York for a week and work in-house. It's only Tuesday but it's already been a great experience.

The Artsy team is incredible â€“ everyone is very good at what they do. I've been making connections with coworkers that I didn't even know I had (the team is actually pretty large).

After quitting my old job in Amsterdam, I had had some self-doubt about whether or not I made the right decision. Not working for a Dutch company, I'd only get to stay a year in Amsterdam. After meeting the Artsy team in-person, I'm now 100% confident that I made the right decision.
