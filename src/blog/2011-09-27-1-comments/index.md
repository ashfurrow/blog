Whenever I see "1 _noun_s" in the software, like "1 items", "1 hours ago", I giggle. It's the kind of thing that's usually indicative of the overall user experience. I wouldn't point to it and say "there it is! The straw that broke the camel's back!", but if someone asked me to select a representative sample of things that were wrong with the app, I would probably pick this.
