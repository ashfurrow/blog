It's been a while since I've written on here, in part because I've been busy at work, in part because I've been on other writing assignments, and in part because my depression has gotten the better of me since adjusting my medication a few months ago.

However, the past week has been amazing. I've been in San Francisco in the lead up to Apple's WWDC next week. I've been spending time with some amazing people and making new friends, while growing closer to existing ones. I've been so filled with energy after seeing so many mates again for the first time in years, in some cases. It's been great.

I met with a doctor a few weeks ago to adjust my medication for something better suited for me. I think it's starting to work. I've begun talking openly about my depression with my friends (previously it was only really mentioned on this blog), and they've all been super-supportive. I'm lucky to be surrounded by such awesome people.

Anyways, you probably won't hear from me again for a few weeks. I'll be busy at the conference, and then writing some iOS 8 tutorials which'll stay under wraps until the NDA lifts. I'm confident that I'm turning the corner on this and, while it's been really hard over the past few months, I feel like I'm on the mend.
