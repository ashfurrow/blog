Ashley and I are still getting used to a lot, including being secluded from our friends and Family out East and the demands of my new job. One thing we're quickly getting used to is the&nbsp;accessibility&nbsp;of almost anything we could possibly want.

Down the street is the [Green Beanery](http://www.greenbeanery.ca/bean/) from where I get my coffee.

Further is an award-winning sushi place that we're quickly becoming fans of.

Just beyond there is a clothing store that sells the most amazing selection of bow ties and made-to-measure clothing (if it tickled me).

All within a 10 minute walk of home. We can get your sushi on, buy a new belt, and grab a vegan cupcake with an Italian soda on your way home. Oh, wait, that's actually what we did tonight.

We love it here.
