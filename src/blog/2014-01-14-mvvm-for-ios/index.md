I've written an introductory post about [Model View ViewModel](http://www.teehanlax.com/blog/model-view-viewmodel-for-ios/) over on the T+L blog. It talks about the need for MVVM in a world of massive view controllers â€“&nbsp;cutting to the motivation behind the framework will hopefully help readers implement the pattern on their own.

Let me know what you think!
