I gave a talk last night at [iOS Toronto](http://www.meetup.com/iOSToronto/) and had a great time. It's nice to get away from the computer and spend time with what my friend describes as "our people."

Those are the slides - if you have any questions, drop me a line. Oh, and if you want to purchase the book mentioned in the slides, [head over to Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430243686/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1430243686&linkCode=as2&tag=ashfur-20) :)
