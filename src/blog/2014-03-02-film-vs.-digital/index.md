I read a [really interesting essay](http://blog.mingthein.com/2014/01/26/film-diaries-choosing-film-or-digital-and-a-little-rationale/) on film vs. digital last night. It reflected my own views that there is no _winner_, they're just different. They have different qualities, a different process for making a photo.

However, I just feel more alive when I'm shooting film.
