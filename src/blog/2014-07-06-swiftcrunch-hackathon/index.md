title: SwiftCrunch Hackathon

After WWDC, once Swift had been announced, I was contacted by some developers in Poland who wanted to organize the first ever Swift hackathon. Really neat idea – and they wondered if I was interested in giving the keynote.

I accepted and am just finishing up the [SwiftCrunch](http://swiftcrunch.com) hackathon now. It's been a fantastic experience – I've met a lot of great developers and had a great time.

Here are my slides from the keynote. They don't give a _tonne_ of context, but it was recorded so I'll post the video later once it's up.

There were some really cool projects that developers came up with – not just apps, but tools for developers to use to make their lives easier. One of the most interesting projects is [SwiftInFlux](https://github.com/ksm/SwiftInFlux), a community-based project for cataloguing the changes that Apple is probably going to make to Swift before 1.0 ships.

My project reproduces [Facebook Slingshot](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/slingshot/id878681557?mt=8)'s UI for presenting notifications, and it's available [on GitHub](https://github.com/AshFurrow/ModalNotificationController).

It was a great learning experience – I filed some radars and learned more about writing idiomatic Swift. I'll put together a blog post with some of my findings later.
