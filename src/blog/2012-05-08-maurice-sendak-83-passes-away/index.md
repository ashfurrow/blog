Children's author Maurice Sendak passed away today. Among other things, he wrote _Where the Wild Things Are_, which was my favourite book as a child.



My grandmother used to read it to me before she passed away. I was young and her death had a profound impact on me. The passing of my favourite childhood author brings back a lot of memories.

It's weird how someone you've never met could have such an impact on your life and how their death can really affect you.
