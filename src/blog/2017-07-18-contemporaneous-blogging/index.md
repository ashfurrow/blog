So I've [written](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/sharing-is-selfish/) – and [spoken](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/sharing-is-selfish/) – about how we should all be blogging as we learn things. It's a good idea for many reasons, some selfish and some altruistic. But I've always said: you really should try and write _as_ you learn something. It's when you're best able to describe and bridge the gap between ignorance and understanding. _As_ you experience the learning process.


However, there are other reasons to blog _as_ you learn something – contemporaneously with the learning process. For example, it's easier to write about a topic when it's fresh in your mind. Also, even if you _mean_ to write about something later, it can easily become an item on a todo list that you're likely to put off and [not get to](https://github.com/ashfurrow/blog/issues/188#issuecomment-315918906).

But another reason to blog contemporaneously is that you may just not be able to write about something in the future. A friend recently was laid off and now a blog post they had written contemporaneously – but not published – is out of context and needs to be changed. That's a lot of work.

If you're able to fit writing into your schedule – please try to. You never know when life circumstances – job, family, housing – could change. Writing about things _as_ you learn them is the best way to capture that knowledge.

Even if you keep it private, writing is a wonderful way to document knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of the subject. I encourage you to try it out, even if writing hasn't been a strength for you. I have faith you'll produce something of value.
