[This article](http://prog21.dadgum.com/154.html) made the rounds this week. It asks the question: "do you want to be programming when you're 50?"

> When I was still a professional programmer, my office-mate once asked out of the blue, "Do you really want to be doing this kind of work when you're fifty?"

Yes. Absolutely, positively, unequivocally _yes_.

Let's stop a think for a second.

_What do I do_?

I solve interesting problems in creative ways.

If that's not your definition for programming, then you're doing it wrong. If that's not what you want do _for the rest of your life_, then you must be an incredibly boring person.

We are makers; we take abstract ideas that exist _only inside our imaginations_ and turn them into concrete, working software. We _make_ things. We are in the same field as painters, writers, and musicians. I hazzard that there aren't many poets out there who don't see themselves writing poetry forever.
