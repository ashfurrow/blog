I've been using [Committed](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/committed/id560767719?mt=12) by [Justin Williams](https://twitter.com/justin) for about a week now and I love it.

Committed posts OS X notifications about commits made to GitHub repos. This is _way_ better than the constant deluge of emails GitHub can send you.

It also does a great job of handling organizations. I'm a member of quite a few, so it's a nice touch.

Check it out in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/committed/id560767719?mt=12).
