Bit of a personal post, but wanted to updated after some tweets I made about my medication.

Things have been going really well for me (which I'd [recently written about](/blog/therapys-end/)) and this medication change kind of came out of the blue. It sucks to find a groove and then have it disrupted, but life is a journey and there are lots of other medications I can try. I'm hopeful that the adverse side-effect that required me to suddenly stop taking one of my meds aren't permanent (it's a neurological problem, so it might be).

The last time I went off this medication (which was a tapered change and not a hard stop, like this time) [things got really hard really quickly](/blog/feelings-are-hard/). It's been nearly two weeks now and while I'm definitely feeling down, but I'm also being proactive about managing the imminent mood problems. For example, I find getting out the door in the mornings to be difficult, and it kind of sets the tone for the whole day. So I have a schedule written out of what exactly to do in the mornings, including some self-care to make sure my mood stays stable throughout the day. It's been helping a lot.

So far, so good. We'll see. I'm in high spirits, for now, but like I've said before: I've got a supportive partner, friends, and work environment. I'll be fine, just need to remember that I'll be fine.
