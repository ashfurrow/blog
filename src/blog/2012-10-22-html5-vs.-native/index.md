Eric Sink as a great article detailing the pros and cons of [HTML5 vs. Native apps](http://www.ericsink.com/entries/html5_vs_native_apps.html).

> When I first started exploring this path, somebody on the team asked me, "Why can't the iPad people just use the web app?"

> Like I said then, web apps and native apps can and will coexist.

> But native apps are just better. They always have been. That's why they cost more.

I have chosen to actively avoid HTML5 mobile app development. I value a quality user experience, and the best quality apps are, and always have been, written natively.
