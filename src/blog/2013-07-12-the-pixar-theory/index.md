I've just read something profound â€“ a [theory](http://jonnegroni.com/2013/07/11/the-pixar-theory/) which posits that every Pixar movie exists within the same universe. Every. Single. One.

> Every movie is connected and implies major events that influence every single movie. Here we go.

You need to stop what you're doing right now and read this.
