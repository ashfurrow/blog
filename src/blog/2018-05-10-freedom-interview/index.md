I was was [interviewed on the Freedom blog][interview] about fighting distraction and fear-of-missing-out. Check it out!

Freedom is an app I used that blocks websites like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc by redirecting network requests to those sites to localhost, which essentially makes them unreachable. I use it in the morning to help me stay focused on getting out the door, and I've noticed that good mornings are correlated with good days. Freedom is a good treatment for [Internet Broken Brain Syndrome][IBB], so check it out if you too are Extremely Online.
