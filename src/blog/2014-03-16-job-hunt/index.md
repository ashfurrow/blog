As I announced on twitter this morning, my job in Amsterdam hasn't worked out. I don't like going into details on these matters, but it suffices to say that I feel like I'm not a good fit for them. Knowing what I know now, I would not have accepted an offer from this company (I hadn't – and won't – name them).

On the surface, leaving this job might not sound like a rational decision. But I've been at jobs before that have cost me my mental health and relationships with my friends and family. I've developed an intuition when something isn't going to work out, and I've learnt to trust it.

So I'm on the job hunt. And I've got a list. The company I end up working for must:

- Respect me. 
- Respect my coworkers.
- Challenge me.
- Exist at the intersection of design and technology. 
- Do good in the world. 

I have found a company that appears to meet my criteria and I am eagerly waiting to hear back from them. Hopefully it works out. Wish me luck.
