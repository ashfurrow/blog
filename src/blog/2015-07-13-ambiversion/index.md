My sister posted [this Buzzfeed listicle](http://www.buzzfeed.com/lukebailey/ambiverts-for-the-silver#.qnmeb9ynLZ) on Facebook. Normally these aren't my bag, but the headline caught me:


> 21 Signs You Might Actually Be An Ambivert

The article describes what it's like to be an "ambivert" – sounds like a made up word to me. But then again, they're all made up...

I found myself reading it, and it all made sense to me. I honestly felt it resonate with me (not the GIFs, just the points it makes). I've always considered myself an introvert for the simple reason that I'm _definitely_ not an extrovert. By process of elimination, then, I must be an introvert. However, articles discussing introversion have never felt like they accurately describe me – close but not a perfect match. 

In the eighth grade, I took a test to see what [personality type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_Codes) I was. I scored equally on Doer, Thinker, and Helper. No clear answer. I felt a bit cheated – I was promised that this test would help me define a career path, but I defied categorization. 

After reading the Buzzfeed article, I Googled the word "ambivert" and found [other people discussing ambiversion](http://lonerwolf.com/ambivert/). One passage specifically resonated with me.

> The notion of Ambiversion changed my life. Previously, when filling in a personality type questionnaire, I'd hesitate when answering questions like: "would you prefer to go to a party or read a book?"  My first thought was "Depends on the party or book and also how tired I am from the previous night." But that contextual option wasn't available. Now I realize what a gift it is to be sensible, reasonable and well balanced enough to have the freedom of choice.

"Whoa", I remember thinking, "_of course_ it would matter what you did the previous night." 

For a few months now, I had been reflecting on how I expend my [energy juices](http://romanjones.deviantart.com/art/How-to-Live-with-Introverts-Guide-Printable-320818879?q=gallery%3Asveidt%2F34464099&qo=3). I love meeting new people, but after events like meetups and conference talks, I always feel _exhausted_. I need time afterward for what I've been calling "decompression" – time to recharge before I'm comfortable socializing again.

Usually, when I cancel going to an event where I need to talk to a lot of people, it's because I'm tired and need to recharge. But sometimes I _must_ go to these events, or sometimes I _really want_ to go. In these cases, I can usually muster the will to "run on fumes."

By necessity, I've gotten fairly good at this "strategic use of extroversion" when it's important. This takes a significant toll on me, to be that person when I'm not naturally in the right mindset to deal with people.

At Istanbul Tech Talks, for example, I needed to be extroverted for my talk even though I was already exhausted from the flight. Until just a few minutes before my talk, I was sleeping backstage, and I returned to the hotel as soon as I could afterward.

Acting extroverted is _sometimes_ a choice that I make to fulfill certain roles or meet certain expectations. But more often than not, I just happen to find myself in that frame of mind. 

I intend to reflect on this idea of ambiversion – these are just some initial thoughts I had on the subject. But I'm really excited to no longer confine myself to the labels that I feel others place on me, or the ones that I place on myself. I no longer see myself as "introverted"; it is neither an accurate or complete description of my personality.

Sometimes I'm extroverted, sometimes I'm introverted, and sometimes I'm somewhere in between. I plan to stop worrying about it. I'll do me.
