title: Solving Problems the Swift Way

Recently, I was asked to speak at [SwiftCrunch](http://swiftcrunch.com), the first ever Swift hackathon. I gave a talk on solving problems using idiomatic Swift; that is, how do we solve problems "the Swift way"?


What's really key – fundamental to both my presentation and my belief about Swift – is that we, as a developer community, are going to face problems in Swift that we are already familiar with. The first time you go to implement `UITableViewDataSource` in Swift, you're going to be solving what's likely a problem you've solved before in Objective-C. This time, you're using Swift. The naïve approach to solving this familiar problem would be to use a familiar solution, but that would be a missed opportunity. Swift presents many new language features and many new ways to solve existing, familiar problems. It would be a shame not to explore those new solutions to see if maybe some of them are better than the Objective-C ones.

So here's my presentation. My slides are [online](https://speakerdeck.com/ashfurrow/solving-problems-the-swift-way-swiftcrunch), too. Please send any feedback you've got!
