(Note: This article was originally titled "Make Sci-fi Great Again", which was wrong when I wrote it and is wrong now. I apologize. Nothing about xenophobia is worth imitating, and so [I renamed the post](https://github.com/ashfurrow/blog/commit/80479cbdaae5b7e243b7d972274d20edf11570df). The post is otherwise unchanged.)

When I was growing up, _Star Trek The Next Generation_ was in syndication, _Voyager_ was still new, and when I got home from school I could catch the final twenty minutes of _Stargate: SG-1_. I watched a lot of sci-fi TV growing up, and there was a good variety of it to watch. There were hopeful what-may-be shows like _TNG_, modern-day romps like _SG-1_, and exposÃ©s on humanity's undoing like _The X-Files_. I wasn't old enough to watch _The X-Files_ and other darker shows, and as a consequence, sci-fi always had a sort of optimism about it.

This tweet got me thinking about sci-fi and how far we've come since the turn of the millennium. When I look around now at sci-fi on TV and on the silver screen, things look a lot less optimistic.

The most recent _Star Trek_ film was about an admiral trying to militarize Star Fleet, _The Walking Dead_ is about the end of human civilization, and the most recent _X-Men_ movie is about going back in time to fix how messed up the future has become. More mainstream films like _The Hunger Games_ show us _just how shitty_ humans might behave to each other, given the right circumstances

It feels, anecdotally, like the stories we tell are no longer hopeful about the future. _At all_. Even not-set-in-this-world stuff like _Battlestar Galactica_ is about humanity _barely_ surviving while being hunted by machines of our own invention.

Huh.

Where is the optimism? Where is the kitsch? Where is the fun?

All our stories are about _survival_. Not exploration. There aren't stories exploring what kinds of problems humanity might have to solve someday because they all assume _we can't solve our problems today_.

That's kind of sad, isn't it?

Why?

I have a hypothesis. We are so inundated by distractions (YouTube, Twitter, 24-hour news, etc etc etc), that to attract audiences and make a buck, movies and TV shows need to _really_ capture our attention. Tales of existential threat from aliens, from zombies, and from ourselves, are really really compelling.

Stories that threaten our lives are compelling, and are very effective at making money. Stories about exploring the galaxy, about making a better future, about bettering ourselves and our species are... just not as good at making money. I mean sure, you can make it work, but why take the risk?

ðŸ˜•

I believe that the real issue is this: that media, including sci-fi, is both a creation of, and creator of, society. The stories we tell betray our hopes and fears, but right now, all we're seeing are fears.

Let's push back. Let's demand optimism from our stories by _being optimistic_ about our _actual_ future. The world is [better, safer than its ever been](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm5xF-UYgdg), but we're always afraid. Yes, there's work to be done to fix the world's problems, but let's not forget what we're fighting _for_: a better tomorrow. Let's be optimistic, and let's live the kind of futuristic stories I watched as a kid. Let's pretend, even for the length of a TV show or film, that tomorrow might be better than today.
