On Friday, I submitted version 1.1 of the [500px iPad app](http://500px.com/ipad) to Apple for approval. I was confident enough in the binary I submitted that it might be bug free, but I also sent it out to beta testers. I figured, hey, if something turns up over the weekend, I'll reject the binary and resubmit Monday, but if not, then I'm ahead 3 days in the approval process. Then this happened:

So, lesson learned. If you're submitted a build to Apple for approval, you'd be be damn sure it's ready for production, because they might decide to release it in only thirteen hours. And there's no rolling back to 1.0.
