Lauren Bacon has a [great article](http://qz.com/47154/tech-companies-stop-hiring-women-to-be-the-office-mom/) discussing offices hiring women to be an "office mom."

> He just didn’t have the awareness to appreciate that a) women don’t want to have all the emotional needs of a workplace delegated to them; b) emotional rapport cannot be the sole responsibility of one person (or gender); c) I’ll bet you dollars to doughnuts that this woman didn’t have “coordinate everyone’s lunches and facilitate office conversations” in her job description; and d) I feel pretty confident she was not given significant financial compensation for those aspects of her work (even though it sounds like those skills were rare gems indeed amongst her coworkers).

She has a great list of questions to ask yourself to see how your workplace stacks up against this subtle form of sexism. A really good read.
