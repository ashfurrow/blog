In case you need reminding why Farscape is arguably the best sci-fi show not written by Joss Whedon, here's my [old article](http://atteroignorantiam.blogspot.com/2011/02/why-farscape-is-awesome.html). All four seasons are up on netflix streaming. Be patient with the first season. It's not that it's not as good, it just uses stock music and that really bothers me. The only strike against it.
