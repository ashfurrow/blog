God I hate [tabloid reporting](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/sep/20/apple-google-maps-headache).

> Google, I hear from roundabout sources, is enjoying the bad press Apple is suffering.

Google isn't a person! It's not _enjoying_ anything!

A "well placed source" could be anyone. Who knows if they know what the fuck is going on.

Facts are that we don't know who severed the Google Maps integration in iOS 6 or for what reason.

Companies aren't people; they don't experience joy, schadenfreude, or orgasmic pleasure at their rivals' discomfort. Stop personifying corporations.
