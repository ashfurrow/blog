I read an [interesting article](http://www.devjoy.com/2013/02/why-do-cars-have-brakes/) this morning comparing brakes on cars to unit tests for software development.

The metaphor is that brakes allow you to drive faster by letting you stop where you want. Unit tests allow you develop faster by letting you stop where you want â€“ when something is broken.

The next time you start a new project, [think about it](/blog/unit-testing-objective-c-using-kiwi).
