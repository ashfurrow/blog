I have been using Google Analytics on my website for nearly its entire existence. Back when it was hosted on Squarespace. Back when it was a Wordpress server. Back when it was served over iWeb.

And I used to really care about the data. I would frequently check to see how many visits my site got. At one point, I even [served ads](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/removing-ads/). The data _mattered_ to me. I _cared_ about it.

But that was a long time ago. I haven't actually checked my analytics in... gosh I don't know how long. I can't remember it. And I haven't _done_ anything with the data for a _long_ time.

Then I saw this:

And it made me wonder: should I be collecting data on visitors to my blog? Does it help me? Who _does_ it help? Who might it hurt?

I didn't have satisfying answers to these questions, so [I have removed Google Analytics tracking from ashfurrow.com](https://github.com/ashfurrow/blog/commit/75a6ca33822613df1c46218b983d6491a4d52349).
