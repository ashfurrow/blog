title: The Twenty Percent

I read an article this morning detailing the complete [failure of Google and handset OEMs to provide existing smartphone users (er, customers?) with OS updates](http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support). The biggest problem here, from my perspective, is added constraints on developers. Developers at the [AndroidTO conference](http://androidto.com/) were talking about building for a particular Android version because it "only" excluded 20% of users. iOS developers typically wait until they're excluding [1% or users, or fewer](http://www.marco.org/2011/08/13/instapaper-ios-device-and-version-stats-update).

Android OEMs and Google need to step up if they expect developers to write apps on their platform.
