PC Mag has listed their [top 100 iPad apps](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2362576,00.asp), and the 500px app I wrote is at the top of the "Entertainment" list. The list is in alphabetical order. But nevertheless awesome.

I'll be interested to see how this affects downloads. I'm already seeing an affect on my mood today.
