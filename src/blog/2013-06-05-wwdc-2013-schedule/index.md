I'm going to be at WWDC 2013 next week. I land Saturday and leave the following Saturday. Normally I'd say if you're in the area, we should get together for a beer. However, my week is super busy this year.

On Monday, the tenth, I'll be speaking about ReactiveCocoa at the [Spotify WWDC Developer Meetup](http://spotifywwdc2.splashthat.com) before heading to the Crashlytics party. Tuesday, I'll be juggling the ReactiveCocoa meeting at the Square offices before going to the [App Camp for Girls Happy Hour](http://wwdcparties.com/details.php?id=1ff0b0559c594c76d2d087b33b68d5bb). Finally, on Wednesday, I'll be speaking at [Pivotal Labs](http://wwdcparties.com/details.php?id=48946f1f845aee1e5e46ce92d8a8b224) on a panel discussing reactions to the keynote and the future of iOS.

If you're attending any of these events, please say hi. Nerd parties are always awkward, but if we're awkward together, it'll work itself out.
