I [posted earlier](https://alpha.app.net/ashfurrow/post/1124726) about my disppointment that there is a scammy faux lock screen app in the top grossing list on the iOS App Store. This developer is taking advantage of people and making what I can only assume is fat stacks of cash in the process.

My next reaction, after disappointment in the developer, was disappointment in _myself_ for being in much less profitable app categories than "Fake Apps." However, I almost immediately realized that's stupid.

I'm not a software developer to make a quick buck off of the naïveté of users. Long after the cash from those sales is spent, I'll still be making amazing software.

Who do I want to be known as? Some creep that takes advantage of people or someone with character who builds quality software? I'm unwilling to sell out my principles for money.
