I've partnered with the good folks down at [Cue](https://www.cueup.com/) to organize a [distributed Objective-C hackathon](https://objectivechackathon.appspot.com) this weekend.

"But Ash", you're thinking, "you're teaching a course this weekend!"

Yes I am. And all of my students will be committing to open source Objective-C. Huzzah!
