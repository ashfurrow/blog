title: Removing Ads
date: 2014-06-10

For the past few years, I've been running this blog with small advertisements on the side (or above if you're on mobile). I've decided to remove them.

I've been blogging a lot more recently with my personal issues with depression, and I've gotten a lot of feedback from readers. People who are supportive of me (thanks for writing â€“ I really appreciate it!) and people who are themselves struggling. I don't feel comfortable selling ad space against this kind of personal content. They'll be gone by the end of June.

I wish Fusion Ads all the best. They've been very kind to me, and if I ever want to sell ads against one of my web properties again, I'll likely return to them.
