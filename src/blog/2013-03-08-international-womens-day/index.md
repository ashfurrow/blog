Today is [International Women's Day](http://www.internationalwomensday.com), whose theme this year is "gaining momentum." While geek culture and the IT workplace are still rife with an abundance of sexist attitudes and practices, I have seen more and more individuals stand up to them lately. It's inspiring to see such positive change happen in your own community.

However, not everyone agrees. Not everyone understands the implications of feminism – that it's not about disempowering men, but rather about empowering women.

In this video, Anita Sarkeesian shows how biased video game storytelling is in favour of the objectification of women. This isn't about taking away from male video game characters – it's about pointing out how video games, which are played during crucial developmental years of a child's life, reinforce the concept that women are objects to be acted upon.

Men benefit from the feminist movement as well.

In this vide, Tony Porter describes his "man box" theory: a collection of stereotypes and expected behaviours _of men_. It really sucks to live outside this box. If the box weren't there – if feminism was successful and these expectations were lifted – it would make mens' lives easier, too.

Feminism isn't about anything other than equality for everyone. The sooner we get there, the better.
