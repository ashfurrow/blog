I've decided to crowdfund my next book on [Indigogo](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/your-first-ios-app/x/2700170) and I'm super pumped!

It's going to be an in-depth, ground-up book on writing your first iOS app. I've had this book on my mind since last September and I'm finally ready to begin work.

Sample code is going to be available on GitHub. Backers at the "Assistant Editor" level are going to get early access to the code and chapters via GitHub.
