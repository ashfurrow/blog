David Smith featured the [article I wrote](/blog/seven-deadly-sins-of-modern-objective-c), as well as [Brent Simmons'](http://inessential.com/2012/12/31/coders_in_the_hands_of_an_angry_god) follow up posts, yesterday on [his podcast](http://developingperspective.com/2013/01/08/103/).

[Developing Perspective](http://developingperspective.com) is a great, daily podcast David Smith does about development topics. It's never longer than 15 minutes and fits right into my daily commute. If you're an Objective-C developer or hobbyist, you really should be listening to it.
