I [wrote recently](/blog/fuji-x100s-review) that I had purchased a Fuji X100S. At the time I reviewed the camera, I really liked it. In the weeks that followed, I've grown to love it. Since moving to Amsterdam I've taken it everywhere. Literally _everywhere_ I go.

Only once have I even brought out my 5D with my 50mm f/1.4 and 24-70 f/2.8 lenses. I just didn't need them because the X100S did everything I needed.

I figured spending two weeks in a new city is about as photographic as I'm going to get, and I only used my 5D once. Once. What the fuck is wrong with me?

The X100S is simply a better camera for me. Fantastic quality in a tiny package.

So I sold my 5D and canon glass.

Crazy I know, but the 5D has always been too much camera for me. I love shooting on primes, and the 35mm equivalent lens on the X100S is a great angle for me. Besides, when I need an interchangeable lens system, I have my Leica M6. Film, sure, but I've been shooting about 50/50 on film since I got here anyway.
