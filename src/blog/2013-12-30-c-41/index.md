My latest app, C-41, is [available](https://github.com/AshFurrow/C-41) as an open source project on GitHub. I'll be submitting it to Apple for approval this week.

I wrote this app as a learning experience. I've learnt a lot about ReactiveCocoa and Model-View-ViewModel in the past few months, but I wanted to apply it to a real-world app that used Core Data, and also has a comprehensive suite of unit tests (still working on that bit).

Take a look. If you have suggestions, open an issue or fork the repo. I learnt a lot from writing C-41 and I hope that other can learn from it, too.
