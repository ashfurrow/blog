I'm on the verge of launching a new app with some friends ( [hint hint](http://35mm.io)) – this app is special. Not only did I build the iOS app, which I generally rock at, but I also built the backend app, which I kinda suck at.

I'm terrified – terrified – of it breaking once people actually start to use it. It's a subscription service – we're charging money for this, and it has to work. If it breaks, I'll be letting my customers and my co-creators down, and it's a lot of pressure.

I've done the usual – set up monitoring services that'll alert me when something breaks, and I'm learning more about automated testing on Node.js to minitigate a failure. What do you all do? Just get used to the omnipresent threat of a downed server?
