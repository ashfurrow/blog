title: Hard Drive Woes

This is the third hard drive I've had fail on me in the last six weeks. Two of them have been SSD's and one was a backup drive. I've lost an entire morning's worth of work while OS X re-downloads to a new drive I just purchased.

But the time I'm losing is nothing compared to the value of the data on those drives.

If you have an SSD, like in a MacBook Air, you might think that since there isn't a lot of data on the drive, it doesn't matter if you back it up or not. But here's the thing: data stored on a drive with such scarce capacity makes that data more valuable. If it didn't matter as much, you wouldn't keep it on such a small drive.

I have everything backed up. My data is safe because I am a professional who cares about that data. I you don't have a good backup solution, ask yourself why not.
