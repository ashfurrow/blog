Last week, I gave [a talk](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/102858222) on the subject of building open source communities. I ended the presentation with the announcement that I'm stepping back from the Moya community.

The talk goes into detail about how open source maintainers should distribute their power and responsibilities as early as possible. Because the fact is, eventually you _will_ be ready to move on to your next project. Your goal as a maintainer really should be to create a project that can outlive your interest in it.

I've spent two and a half years focusing on the community of Moya, rather than just the codebase, and I'm grateful to the team of core contributors that are ready to take over for me. They have my full confidence.

I hope that when you're ready to move on from your next project, you've built up a community ready to take over for you, too.
