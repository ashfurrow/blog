I really enjoyed [this week's NSHipster](http://nshipster.com/nscharacterset/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NSHipster+%28NSHipster%29). It discusses the uses, and misuses, of `NSCharacterSet` as well as a few other obscure-ish string-related classes.

If you don't already follow [NSHipster](http://nshipster.com), you really should. In the worst case, you already knew about the topic being discussed (but _you would_ already have heard of that, wouldn't you?) and best case, you learn something super useful.

> And if not being wrong isn’t the most important thing about being an NSHipster, then I don’t want to be right!
