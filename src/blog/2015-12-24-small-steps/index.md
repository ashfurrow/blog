So the other night, I saw Steve Streza tweet about the new _Star Wars_ film, specifically about JJ Abrams' style in directing the film.

Awesome, I _love_ film grain. Before I could convince myself it was a bad idea, I looked up showtimes for a theatre here in the East Village and bought tickets for a showing a few hours later.

Now, this may not seem like a big deal, but it has been over two years since I spontaneously went to the movies. Movies – especially new releases like _The Force Awakens_ – are filled with other people. There are abundant opportunities for social awkwardness, line-ups for the bathroom, and a host of other things that are difficult if you have an anxiety disorder.

But we went, and it was great! It was so cool to put _some_ energy into going to the movies and get _more_ energy out of it.

Think of depression like [nuclear ignition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility). Fusion takes _a lot_ of energy, and usually you end up spending more energy than you harness. But the other night was different.

Enjoying a night out to the movies sounds like a small step, [and it is](/blog/depression-graphed/), but it's also a necessary one if I want to get back to feeling like myself full-time. Watching _The Force Awakens_ inspired a new hope for my recovery.
