Some of my oldest memories are of riding in my father's 1998 red Toyota 4runner listening to a cassette tape of the Moxy Früvous album _Bargainville_ (1993). I was walking this morning and I put the album on and it still really speaks to me.

I was always fond of _River Valley_ because it's a catchy tune, and I grew up in a river valley. Listening to it today, during the incipient climate collapse, is chilling.

Anyway. I kept listening, and kept hearing the same sort of left-wing anthems come through. I mean, this seems on the nose by contemporary standards, but in the 90's this was somewhat subversive stuff.

Anyway, if you're interested in listening to 90's Canadian folk rock, you could do a lot worse than _Bargainville_.
