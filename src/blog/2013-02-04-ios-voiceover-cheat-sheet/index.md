Grey Raiz has a [very nice VoiceOver cheat sheet](http://www.raizlabs.com/blog/2012/12/18/ios-voiceover-getting-started-guide/). Every app developer should read this and bookmark it.

Honestly, after reading his list, even I discovered a few new tricks.

Remember, iOS has two interfaces: a visual one and an aural one. You need to know how to use them both effectively in order to build your best apps.
