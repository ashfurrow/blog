I'm going to be attending the [NSNorth](http://nsnorth.ca) conference this April in Ottawa.

It looks like an interesting, non-technical conference and a really great opportunity to meet interesting, like-minded professionals working in iOS. I'm really looking forward to it.

If you're going to be in the area, please let me know!
