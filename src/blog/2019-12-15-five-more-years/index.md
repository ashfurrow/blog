title: 5 More Years of Building Software
date: 2019-12-15
banner: pairing.jpg
---

In 2009, I started writing iOS apps. Five years later [I wrote a retrospective
of my career so far](/blog/5-years-of-ios/). Well, it's been another five years,
so here is my next career lookback.

My first retrospective covered my graduation from university, me jumping around a few startups, working for
a design studio, and finally joining Artsy. _This_ retrospective covers most of my work at Artsy.
When I joined Artsy in 2014, it was about 40 people large, and
now it's around 200! So this retrospective is necessarily going to cover not
just the ways that _I've_ grown, but some ways how Artsy has grown, too. [This blog post took six months to
write](https://github.com/ashfurrow/blog/pull/396). Strap in, folks!

Cast yourself back to December 2014. Where were you? My wife Ashley and I were living in Amsterdam, but
our Dutch visas were about to expire. We'd be moving to New York soon. I'd been working for Artsy for eight
months and had [just shipped my first
app](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/11/13/eidolon-retrospective/) for the company,
in beta versions of Swift! ([It's open
source](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon), by the way.) I had also been battling
severe depression throughout my entire time in Amsterdam,
but had stabilized somewhat ([I would begin therapy soon](/blog/depression-graphed/)).

description: [
'By 2015, Swift was public and gaining in popularity. I was an early advocate for the language and based on my experience building the Kiosk for Artsy, I was writing blog posts and giving conference talks on Swift.',
'This was really fun! Swift felt new and exciting, despite the rough edges of the early language betas. It felt nice to dig into a new language and figure things out for the first time.',
'I didn’t realize it at the time, but the process of learning <em>one</em> language and its idioms would set me on a path to learning yet more languages. Eventually, this path would lead me to become a generalist. '

'In February, my wife and I left Amsterdam.',
'It was bittersweet. We&apos;d lived there a year, and we always knew it would only ever be <em>a</em> year; Artsy hired me with the understanding that I would move to New York after my Dutch visa expired.',
"Two weeks before I left Amsterdam, something really special happened: Artsy hired <a href='https://twitter.com/alloy'>Eloy Durán</a> of CocoaPods and RubyMotion fame! I’d gotten to know Eloy as a friend through CocoaPods and, just before leaving Amsterdam, had the pleasure of getting to know him in-person as a colleague. "

'Yet here I was, moving to New York. We spent 6 hours of limbo between our Airbnb and an apartment we’d found (no small feat for a foreigner with no Social Security Number or credit history). We brought everything we owned, and our cats, to the Artsy office to spend the Saturday. '

My friend, <a href='https://twitter.com/samuelgoodwin'>Samuel</a>, ran a &ldquo;Peer Lab&rdquo;, a weekly meetup for developers to work independently, but in the same space. I looked forward to it each week.",

'I would spend the next half decade leaning further and further into this idea, of sharing knowledge. It would come to define the core of my practice as a professional. I can trace a lot of how I approach my day-to-day to ideas I first expressed in <em>this</em> talk.'

'Artsy’s HQ is located at 401 Broadway, beside Manhattan’s Chinatown. I’d been working at the office 5 days a week, with Peer Labs on Saturday, so I developed a bit of emotional connection to the space.',
'My wife and I were renting one bedroom out of a two-bedroom apartment; it never quite felt like home. In the absence of a <em>real</em> home, I think I was drawn to the office as a place of stability.',
'Attaching your personal sense of stability to your employer is never a great idea – businesses are inherently unstable, so mooring your sense of self to them can lead to difficult emotions. I’ve always struggled with this, and I still do. '

description: [
"After UIKonf uploaded the video recording of my <em>Teaching &amp; Learning</em> talk, I shared it within Artsy. That afternoon, Carter (Artsy’s CEO) called me on the phone. He said &ldquo;I watched your talk. Let’s do it.&rdquo; And so Artsy created a new blog, <a href='https://www.artsy.net/life-at-artsy'> <em>Life at Artsy</em> </a>.",
"My colleague, Remy Ferber, worked on the initial post, <a href='https://www.artsy.net/article/remy-ferber-open-sourcing-company-culture-at-artsy'><em>Open-Sourcing Company Culture at Artsy</em></a>. In it, she says &quot;By promoting openness, we mitigate fear of judgment and embrace our mistakes as positive experiences to learn from and share with others.&quot; This is really key – it speaks to a concept that I didn’t yet have the vocabulary to describe: psychological safety.",
'Since starting at Artsy, I understood that the &ldquo;arts team&rdquo; (as it was known then) had a strong influence on our engineering culture. The <em>Life at Artsy</em> blog was one of the first times I helped the engineering team export <em>our</em> culture back into the broader company. It was really rewarding.'

title: 'Product Work',
description: [
'My product work in 2015 wasn’t that focused. I worked on Artsy Engineering’s &ldquo;Mobile Team&rdquo; (as opposed to its &ldquo;Web Team&rdquo;) and I just build whatever mobile software Artsy needed. I had a tonne of leeway to decide what to work on, but I didn’t always have the business context I needed to make that decision.',
'Looking back, I notice that I was a bit incurious about that business context. I just wanted to make apps. Apps apps apps. But apps aren’t made in a vacuum, and I would spend the next few years getting more and more interested in Artsy’s business (and, critically, how technology can help it thrive). '

"I gave a talked titled <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlLhtWLghGA'><em>Loosely Held Strong Convictions</em></a> in Italy in 2015. I wanted to talk about something that was more important than just programming computers. I spoke about why humans believe the things we do, how we think about our own beliefs, and why we divide ourselves into groups. Heavy stuff for a technology conference.",
"After the conference, I ran into some conference attendees at the airport. They told me something I’ll never forget: they told me that my talk had made them think about the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis'>migration crisis</a> with a new perspective.",
'As time went on, I gave fewer and fewer conference talks. However, each one became more and more important. '

"I decided that the next skill that I wanted to master was <a href='https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-online-communities/'>build online communities</a>. I considered Artsy Engineering one type of online community, while <a href='https://github.com/Moya/Moya'>Moya</a> was another type.",
'After making this decision, I told Artsy’s CTO dB, who supported me. I started spending Artsy time researching team dynamics and skills to manage them. I had started down this path enough to realize how little I knew, and I was hungry for more.',
'This was the very beginning of development of my philosophy of software development, which we’ll see unfold over the next few years. '

'I ended 2015 by helping to form Artsy Engineering’s <em>Auctions Team</em>. My product work in 2015 hadn’t been terribly focused, and I was excited to begin the new year on a new team, focused on building software for Artsy’s burgeoning Auctions business.',
'The new team also included a new manager, Alan. Over the next few years, I’d learn a lot from Alan, on both the technical and non-technical sides of software development.',
"Our first big event was was <a href='https://www.artsy.net/article/sotheby-s-sotheby-s-first-online-only-auction-input-output'> Sotheby’s Input/Output </a> auction. Sotheby’s is a big player in the auction world, so working with them was a big deal for Artsy. This was kind of stressful! But was a good preparation for the stress that would come next year, building Live Auctions Integration. "

'If 2015 lacked focus, 2016 made up for it (and then some).',
"January kicked off six months of <em>intense</em> work on the nascent Auctions team, building Live Auctions Integration (LAI). At the time, Artsy only supported <a href='https://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/04/17/building-an-english-auction-with-mongodb/'> <em>timed auctions</em></a>: the auction had a pre-set end time and, when that time arrived, whoever was the highest bidder on each lot won that lot.",
'LAI was different. We would be sending an Artsy employee to an actual auction room, to represent all Artsy online bidders. Anyone using Artsy could, in real-time, bid on lots as if they were in the room themselves.',
'That was the idea, anyway. We had a lot of work ahead of us – we wanted to ship an MVP in 4 months. '

"The photo here depicts a billing with me and <a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0270665/'> Danielle Feinberg</a>, a lighting artist and director of photography at Pixar. She and I got to chat over a few meals at the conference, and she even attended my talk on functional reactive programming! Meeting Danielle Feinberg had a big impact on me and my career. She inspired me to think harder about the topics that I talk about at conferences, to tell stories at a larger scale. "

"So far, my wife and I had been living in the United States on a <a href='https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/tn-nafta-professionals'>TN-1 visa (&ldquo;the NAFTA visa&rdquo;)</a>. This visa had some restrictions that we were initially okay with, but grew tired of as time went on. Border crossings were consistently stressful, as it’s a weird kind of a weird visa. Especially entering from Europe, airlines get really fussy. Etc.",
'Ashley and I decided to ask Artsy to look into our options. Artsy hired a lawyer and we decided to apply for our Green Cards; this would make us Permanent Residents of the United States.',
'The decision wasn’t easy. We’d been living away from our families for a few years, and missed home, but felt that being closer (than Amsterdam) would be a reasonable compromise. And living outside Canada already just made the prospect of continuing to do so... justified, somehow. That’s how it felt, anyway.',
'This kicked off three years of paperwork, appointments, and headaches. But I have to thank Artsy, especially Gray and Michelle, for always being there to help. '

{
title: 'LAI Setbacks',
description: [
"Building something new is never easy, and we were trying to build something <em>very</em> new. The backend was written in Scala, using <a href='https://akka.io'>Akka</a> for actor-based programming. The web front-end was written in React (a relatively new technology at Artsy, at the time) and the iOS front-end was written in Swift. Both front-ends communicated to our backend over GraphQL for static data (lot estimates, artist names, etc) and a websocket backend for realtime data (current number of bids, the current highest bid, etc).",
'All this new technology took time to learn. The Auctions team started getting help from other Artsy engineers, especially Orta and another Senior Engineer, Craig. I would say that we had about half of Artsy Engineering working on the LAI launch, with the other half cheering us on.',
'Despite our hard work, we had missed our 4-month launch target. The pressure was on.'

'At the time, I didn’t think of the LAI work as a &ldquo;crunch&rdquo; time. Looking back, I still don’t think the term fits the situation. It was more like, there were times that I had to get some space from my work. And that was unusual for Artsy. (I was always able to get that space, and avoided burning out.)',
'Everyone on the team knew that LAI was important, but we also knew that we had to balance working hard with a sustainable pace. Alan and Devang made sure that everyone on the team knew that this was a one-off situation, that crunch time would <em>not</em> become the norm. They would keep their word.',
'A nice side-effect of the intensity LAI development was the equal intensity of the bonds our team formed. I will never forget what it felt like working with Alan, Sarah, Erik, Chris, Katarina, and Barry (with help from Orta and Craig). '

Like, I knew launching LAI quickly was important, but I didn’t really understand the consequences of what would happen if we failed. And I’m glad I didn’t, to be honest.',
'I was handling the stress <em>okay</em>. Not the best, but not the worst for sure. If I’d known how much was riding on this going well, it would have only made me feel worse.',
'Looking back, as a more leadership-y engineer, I have a profound appreciation for how Alan and Devang handled that stress, with what seemed like unwavering grace. That’s a kind of grace I aim for now.',
"The launch was a total success. <a href='https://artsy.github.io/blog/2016/08/09/the-tech-behind-live-auction-integration/'>Our software worked like a charm</a>, and after the launch, we were all encouraged to take as much time off as we needed. "

This came at a pretty important time for me, since I was earnestly researching team dynamics, which is an important theme of the show. Orta called <em>Steven Universe</em> &ldquo;the most &lsquo;Ash Furrow&rsquo; show&rdquo;, which I took as quite the compliment.",
'If I had to boil <em>Steven Universe</em> down, really far, I would say that the show’s message is a coming-of-age story that questions the idealism-versus-pragmatism dichotomy. Steven has his ideals, and the entire world around him pushes him to be pragmatic. The show’s answer to this conflict is: &ldquo;no, these ideals <em>are</em> pragmatic.

I found this work really fulfilling. <a href='https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/02/02/artsy-apogee/'>There were lots of opportunities for my professional growth</a>.

"In 2016, Artsy had introduced React Native into our iOS app. I had largely ignored it because I thought, and hoped, that it would fizzle out. To my dismay at the time, it didn’t. I eventually wrote <a href='https://ashfurrow.com/blog/swift-vs-react-native-feels/'> this blog post </a> early 2017 about dealing with these feelings, but in my opinion, the post hasn’t aged well. It still has me holding on to Swift as the future of iOS at Artsy.",
'The problem is – rather, <em>my</em> problem <em>was</em> – that I was too attached to my tools. I had the strong convictions, but they were too tightly held. I ignored React Native because I assumed it would be worse than what I was using. I had my head in the sand and missed out on a huge opportunity to help define what React Native at Artsy would look like. Since Artsy’s app is open source, it became a popular resource for how to build React Native apps <em>for everyone</em>. Even now, years later, I still feel like I’m playing catch-up to our technology stack. I missed my chance to be there on the ground floor, and it’s one of my biggest professional regrets. '

"Weirdly enough, I started doing work in React (for the web) before I ever touch React Native. Part of this is because of how <a href='https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/04/17/making-a-components-pod/'> Artsy divided the React Native and native iOS parts of our app </a> – I just didn’t need to know React Native to work in our app, because components I worked in were all Objective-C or Swift. Rather, I began contributing to web projects on the Auctions team which were in React. Specifically, they were using React and Redux, with GraphQL and websocket backends. Compared to the sophisticated tooling I’m used to now, the front-end code was a bit primitive. But because it was so close to vanilla JavaScript and CSS, it was easy to dive into. I enjoyed contributing to the Auctions team software, whether it was in Scala or Rails or Swift, but especially in React. It was so fun!",

Our former visas, as well as the Green Card process itself, had some restrictions that we’d been living with for years. They were finally lifted.',
'I can’t tell you how weird it feels. I never thought I’d <em>live</em> in the United States. And yet, here I am. New York feels like home. I miss Canada (some days a lot more than others), but living outside my home country has also given me an interesting perspective <em>on</em> that country. I really appreciate that perspective. And with our Green Cards, we’re now able to visit easier than ever before. '

"So yeah. After coming out to myself as bisexual, I had to figure out what to do next. The decision of whether to tell anyone else – my wife, my family, or even the whole world. I didn’t want to for a long time, but I realized that I didn’t want to because I was afraid. And after years of hiding, I didn’t want to be afraid anymore. I told my wife, who totally supported me, and then waited for our immigration process to complete (our marriage needed to be verified by the United States government, and I wasn’t taking any chances). Finally, <a href='/blog/coming-out/'>I came out in a blog post</a>.",
"I wrote the blog post at Peer Lab in the morning, but in my head, I’d been writing it for months. I got my wife to read it over for typos (she often helps me edit my posts, thank you Ashley 🙏) and then pushed it into the world. <a href='https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/1137463336235347969'>I tweeted about it</a>. People responded with overwhelming support and positivity. It felt amazing.",
"<a href='https://thenib.com/i-came-out-late-and-that-s-okay'>Coming out late in life</a> isn’t a common story you hear about, and it involves navigating a lot of unfamiliar emotions. I’m having to figure things out, but I’m not alone. And at last, I get to be my whole self.",

description: [
"Near the end of 2019, <a href='https://twitter.com/alloy/status/1203981302652899329'>my manager Eloy</a> left Artsy. I miss working with him already, but I’m excited for what’s coming next for him.",
'Eloy’s departure makes me the last remaining member of Artsy’s original Mobile Team. There’s <em>a lot</em> of responsibility, but I feel set up for it. When I look back on my early feelings about React Native (I didn’t like it <em>at all</em>), I really regret keeping my head in the sand for so long. I missed my chance to participate in decisions that formed the foundation of Artsy’s iOS architecture, and yet now I find myself responsible for that architecture. I need to have opinions about what it should look like in the future, to help Artsy meet its business goals. It’s challenging work, but I’m not doing it alone. (See the next section.)',
'There is more responsibility to shoulder than just the technical aspects of Artsy’s products, though. Departures by dB, Orta, and now Eloy, all left our engineering team short on cheerleaders. Cheerleaders are people who guide and shape Artsy’s culture by empowering people to succeed <em>in</em> the culture they want to build. Throughout the changes at Artsy this year (and the inevitable culture turbulence that comes with <em>any</em> company change), I found myself stepping up.',
'I’m putting my principles into action. All my research into team dynamics and so-called &ldquo;soft skills&rdquo; is paying off. I have both the cultural and the institutional authority I need to have have <em>huge</em> impact on the future of Artsy. I’m surrounded by other leaders who want to help me succeed. I feel empowered. I feel motivated. I feel excited.',
'Nearly six years at Artsy has taught me many things, chief among them that <em>change is constant</em>. Artsy’s always been changing: growing, making mistakes, and learning from them. Change has always been constant.',
'While I’d by lying if I said some changes don’t feel more significant than others, changes are opportunities, too. I’m excited take full advantage of them. '

"When I returned from vacation in August, I found an <a href='https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/playbooks/rfcs.md'>RFC</a> in my inbox: should Artsy have a mobile team again? And I was <em>very</em> excited.",
"Artsy <em>had</em> a Mobile team when I started, but it was dissolved in 2016. <a href='https://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/03/17/three-years-of-react-native/'>We adopted React Native</a>, in part, to <a href='https://github.com/artsy/README/blob/master/culture/engineering-principles.md#de-silo-engineers'>&ldquo;de-silo&rdquo; our engineering teams</a>. It worked, but it had some consequences on the software we built (see: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law'>Conway’s Law</a>). It was time to dedicate a team to making the app awesome.",
'We formed Artsy’s Mobile Experience team in October. We started with limited resources, but we’re planning to grow and we have big goals. Artsy’s leadership has empowered us to drive our iOS products forward, and I’m pumped to be leading this team.',
'I was really excited to get to create a new team, become a Tech Lead again, and return to working on iOS software every day. I had gained a really wide perspective on software development, and it was time to zoom back in on a technical domain that I am intimately familiar with. I’m still new to being a Tech Lead, but by all accounts, I am <em>crushing</em> it. We have already accomplished so much as a team. The future of iOS at Artsy is very bright. '

There's a lot of uncertainty in my life right now. There've been a lot of changes
lately, both professionally [and personally](/blog/learning-to-run/). Five years
ago, I called myself an "iOS Developer", but now I don't scope myself to a single
platform. I'm leading a team, and I'm helping lead Artsy through a critical part
of its growth as a company and as a business.

{% tweet "1179840250518134785" %}I don't know where I'll be, or who I'll
be, in another five years. But I'm so excited for the journey. Thanks for
reading, and take care.
