Great article on [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2012/9/19/3358132/samsung-mock-iphone-5-commercial) discussing Samsung's latest Galaxy S3 ad, which mocks Apple users.

Classy, guys.

The Verge comments that it's strange to mock potential customers, but I don't think that's what Samsung is aiming for here.

Samsung is looking for centrist consumers who probably might not even have a smart phone yet, and who think that waiting in line overnight for a _cell phone_ is silly. People like my mom.

I'm not sure people won over by such a negative ad are the kind of customers Apple wants, and I don't think they're the kind of customers I want, either.
