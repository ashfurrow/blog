[Great article](http://fuckjetpacks.com/read/one_of_my_favorite_buttons) discussing the "Use Last Photo Taken" button in Tweetbot (hat tip to [David Gillis](https://twitter.com/davegillis) for tweeting this).

> But it's fantastic interaction design all the same. It's this attention to detail, this relentless drive to add just a little more delight or remove a little pain, this tendency to never be satisfied with the status quo that can lead to great things.

I use this all the time. In fact, almost every time I upload a photo to Twitter, it's via that button.

It wasn't _difficult_ to add that button. All the developer's had to do was give a damn.

**Update** : My friend [Jason](http://twitter.com/jasonbrennan) wrote in to tell me it was actually Nevan Mrgan who suggested the idea last November, an idea to which Tapbots credited him.

> Half-baked idea: iOS apps that display a photo-picking sheet, "Take Photo", "Choose Existing"? Add 3rd option, "Last Photo Taken". 95% case.

I guess in addition to giving a damn, it also helps to listen to your users. Turn out.
