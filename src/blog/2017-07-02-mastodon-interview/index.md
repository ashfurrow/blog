[Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org): still a thing. And [my instance](https://mastodon.technology), also still a thing! Recently, one of the users on mastodon.technology sat down and [interviewed me](http://www.smays.com/2017/06/ash-furrow/) about the platform and the project.

My participation in Mastodon hasn't been steady, but neither was my participation in Twitter at first. I'm still finding my feet and my voice there. I still don't know what the future holds; this is still an experiment, but I'm excited to see where we end up together.
