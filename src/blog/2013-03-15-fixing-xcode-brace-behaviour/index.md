title: Fixing Xcode Brace Behaviour
date: 2013-03-15

My friend [Zev](https://alpha.app.net/zev) maintains a [great library](https://github.com/ZevEisenberg/ios-convenience) for fixing Xcode's code snippets behaviour to put new brace brackets on their own line.

He's also got a section of his `.zprofile` in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/ZevEisenberg/5167026) so he can type `fixXcode` and it'll clone the repo and do everything for you. Like magic.

He sent it to be, and I was hesitant at first because it involves using `zsh` instead of `bash`. I mean, only nerds use `zsh` right?

Right!

`zsh` has autocomplete for git. That is _all_ you need to know to switch.
