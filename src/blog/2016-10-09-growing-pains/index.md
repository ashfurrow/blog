Artsy did it's six-monthly peer performance (performance?) reviews and I got lots of meaningful feedback, including "aww yeah, Ash is great" comments from colleagues and my manager. I want to reflect a bit on the review, my direction, and my goals.


Artsy's process involves a self-evaluation, peer evaluations, and a meeting with one's manager. All the feedback is non-anonymous. The evaluations measure performance and teamwork separately, but both of them against Artsy's values:

- Quality Worthy of Art
- People are Paramount
- Openness
- Positive Energy
- Art x Science

I gave myself good marks for performance and great marks on teamwork. It's a struggle to give an honest, not-depression-tinted review of my own abilities, so it was a struggled to say "I'm great." I also said that I need to stop taking things so personally and to get better at conflict resolution.

My manager told me that I was being hard on myself, that he was proud of what I had accomplished and that I had full latitude to continue working on new strategies to improve our team's dynamics. So that was pretty cool.

My goals are to continue to focus on [community-building](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/building-online-communities/) and expand into manager-type responsibilities. I'm not sure if a "manager" is what I want to be, but the skills are important to acquire in either case.

One other note: I dislike awkward situations, like _really_ dislike them. But my work often involves things like disagreeing with others and giving critical feedback to colleagues. Obviously no Canadian likes disagreeing with anyone, but I take it to an extreme. So I'm going to start pushing towards that awkwardness, like a kind of exposure therapy. So look forward to more unsalted opinions and blog posts even more awkward than sharing one's peerformance review.
