title: iOS Japan Tax Thing
date: 2012-02-12

For a long time I excluded Japan in my list of countries I sell apps to; it's a simple process in iTunesConnect. I did this because, two years ago, I read something funny about Japan and "extra forms" or something and I decided this was easier. I changed my mind six months ago, which didn't really _change_&nbsp;anything since none of my apps were in Japanese.

Well that changed in December when I released my [update](/blog/solar-system-simulator-update/) to my Solar System Simulator app.

Marco Arment posted a link to a [very informative article](http://david-smith.org/blog/2012/02/01/understanding-japanese-app-store-withholding/) on how this works and how to stop the Japanese Government from withholding 20% of your app revenue. I checked and, in fact, I had lost over Â¥&nbsp;800 in December.

It's only about $10 in Canadian Dollars, but it'll add up. And from a principled perspective, I'm being taxed when I oughtn't to.
