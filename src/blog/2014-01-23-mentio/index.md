Came across an interesting app called [Mentio](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/mentio-personal-media-wish/id796557338?mt=8&uo=4&at=1l3v6zC) that serves as a wishlist for apps, movies, and albums.

It's really neat how it integrates in with the iTunes catalogue. I assume it's using affiliate links to make money somehow. What a novel idea. Wish I had thought of it.
