title: Switching from GMail to FastMail

I'm beginning a switch from GMail to my own hosted IMAP service at [FastMail.fm](http://www.fastmail.fm/?STKI=7977317). This represents a larger shift in my online presence that began over a year ago. It started with a move away from Blogger to my own hosted WordPress blog, and is representative of my desire to have more control over my data. "Control" isn't the right word - I am becoming more selective over who I choose to allow access to my data.

I've been avoiding it for some time now - about 6 months, in fact. Google came out with Google+, their half-assed attempt at a social networking. Their effort to force me to be social in the way I search has been getting creepier and creepier the whole time, at once collecting more information while making it harder and harder to use their services. A combination of recent changes to their site designs and services, and an explanation by [Marco Arment](http://wiki.5by5.tv/wiki/Kindacritical_(5by5_Specials_4)) about how he would switch if he were on GMail, finally got me to take the plunge.

All of my GMail inbound mail is forwarded to [ash@ashfurrow.com](mailto:ash@ashfurrow.com). I was going to go with "me@ashfurrow.com", but Paddy and Jason pointed out that, from their perspective, it really should be "you@ashfurrow.com", so I've avoided pronouns altogether.

It's a different feeling. I _own_&nbsp;my data. Yes, I am responsible for it, but I'm _the only person who can read my email_.

I'm having GMail retain a copy of forwarded messages for now to make sure everything is working correctly. I'll be using 1Password to determine which sites I use my old GMail address to log in with and change those profiles. Hopefully, by the end of March, I'll be ready to have GMail delete all forwarded messages. I also want to move any archived mail to a personal IMAP backup. By the end of 2012, I'm planning on being able to delete my Google Account altogether.

Why so long? Because it's not just mail: it's my Google Analytics for my websites and iOS apps; It's the Google Documents that I share with my wife; It's our monthly budget that Google has access to. It's everything they have.

Let me be perfectly clear here: Google has never let me down. For years - as long as I've been a user - they have provided improvement after improvement and haven't asked for a dollar in return. They kept making their services better and better, and I've never once had a problem getting access to my data. But lately, they've been creeping me out: removing features from Google Documents without any prior notice, for instance. They can just make a decision and it could affect _any part_&nbsp;of my life. That kind of stresses me out, man! If I host my own mail, yes it's a pain, but it's also a delight to know that I am bound only to a domain to which I own the rights.

If you're thinking of making the switch and moving to FastMail, please use my [affiliate link](http://www.fastmail.fm/?STKI=7977317). Their user interface isn't exactly _great_, but I managed to figure out what to do. These instructions are for changing from GMail to FastMail at a custom domain you already own:

1. Create an account. To use email at an existing domain, like I'm doing, you'll need their "Enhanced" plan. It's $40/year and includes 10GB of email storage, full access to POP/IMAP/SMTP/Jabber, and lots of other features (like using your own host).
2. Options -> Virtual Domains -> Add Domain. In my case, this was ashfurrow.com.
3. Options -> Virtual Domains -> Add Alias. Here you set up the email address at which you want to receive mail. Wildcards are acceptable here, as well.
4. If you're currently using Google Accountshttp://google.com/a/cpanel/_ashfurrow.com_, replacing my domain with yours and delete all of your users and then under Account Settings, delete your account.
5. Add custom MX records to your DNS provider. I host over Dreamhost, so I logged into the Panel, clicked "Mail" to open their sidebar menu, clicked "Custom MX/Gmail" and finally "edit" beside my domain. You want to add "Custom MX Records." _ **Do not** _&nbsp;change your name server DNS records unless you want to host your website with FastMail, too. The MX records are:
  - in1-smtp.messagingengine.com, priority=10
  - in2-smtp.messagingengine.com, priority=20
6. Wait.
7. Eventually, FastMail will email you to let you know the transfer was successful. At this point, you can set up your mail client using [their settings](https://www.fastmail.fm/help/remote_email_access_server_names_and_ports.html?MLS=VD-*&Ust=82c0e469.8cbc41d7&MSS=!OP-*&UDm=49).
8. Start forwarding any email to your new address.

In a month's time, I'll let you know how I'm faring.
