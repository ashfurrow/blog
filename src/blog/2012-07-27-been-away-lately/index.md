title: Been Away Lately

Regular readers of my blog may have noticed that I haven't posted lately. Mostly, this has been because photography has taken up most of creative energy (outside of my job, anyway). Additionally, after contributing a few chapters to [a book on Objective-C](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430243686/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1430243686&linkCode=as2&tag=ashfur-20) was pretty taxing on me as a writer.

I was not expecting the insane amount of work that was required in writing a technical book. It really made me question my prowess as an Objective-C developer and as a writer.

If you're interested in my growth as a photographer, you can take a peak at my best work on my [500px profile](http://500px.com/ashfurrow). I'll try to post more regularly here.
