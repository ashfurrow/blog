My friend Lauren has started her first blog by the name of [The Endless Soapbox](http://laurenevail.wordpress.com/). She lists me as an inspiration for her newly conceived collection of musings; hopefully she won't restrict herself to topics like style and computer linguistics, or we'll become direct blog competitors and our respective competitive personalities will destroy our friendship.
