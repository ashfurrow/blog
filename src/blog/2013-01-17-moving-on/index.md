title: Moving On

There have been a lot of things on my mind, lately. Well, over the past 7 months, even. Those things came to a head in December when I made the decision to leave my role at 500px as their Lead iOS Developer.

2012 saw a lot of changes to the team, which tripled in size. These changes were to the logistics of running a successful startup, to the management structure, and to the culture of the company. From my perspective, many of these changes were positive, but some were not. 500px became a place where I was not happy and I felt I could no longer do my best work.

My decision came after many weeks of contemplation, conversations with trusted friends and coworkers, and dialogue with the 500px management about what we could do to improve my work environment. Ultimately, I decided that it is time to move on.

I wish nothing but the best of luck to my former colleagues. 500px has been good to me and good for me. I have grown as a person, as a professional, and as a photographer, and I want to thank them for the opportunity to work there.

I have a rule on my blog that I do not talk about work. I talk about the projects I'm on, but not my workplace itself. I only ask that you respect my decision to leave and do not ask about the specifics. Thank you all.
