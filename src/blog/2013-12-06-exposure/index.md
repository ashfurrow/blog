I got my invitation to [Exposure](https://exposure.so) yesterday. Really great site. They're clearly still in the early days, so I'm giving them a pass on a lot of things, but they have thought things through enough to have a really polished MVP. You can see my first post on a [trip to the zoo](https://ashfurrow.exposure.so/zoo-trip).

_This_ is what I'm talking about. Storytelling through photography without any of the distraction of social media bullshit. It's more than a portfolio – it's like a Medium but for photographers. Check it out.
