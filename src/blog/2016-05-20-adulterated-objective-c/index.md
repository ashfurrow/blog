There’s been a lot of discussion lately surrounding the efficacy of Swift. Brent Simmons has been [writing](http://inessential.com/2016/05/18/what_im_doing_with_these_articles) about his experiences using Swift. As an expert Objective-C developer, his insights are worth paying attention to; he notes that tools at hand when developing Objective-C are either missing in Swift, or clumsy to use. [Responder chains](http://inessential.com/2016/05/15/a_hypothetical_responder_chain_written_i), [adding functions to objects at runtime](http://inessential.com/2016/05/18/dynamic_methods), and [selector reflection](http://inessential.com/2016/05/14/the_tension_of_swift). I suggest you read all his posts.

However, I feel the need to point out that there are a lot of iOS developers out there who don’t use those tools, or may not even be aware of them. Consequently, they may not share Brent Simmons’ frustration at their absence.

Objective-C’s dynamic nature exists as an integral part of UIKit, and as Craig Hockenberry [has pointed out](http://furbo.org/2016/05/20/adulterated-swift/), your app is still built atop an Objective-C foundation even if the code you write is 100% Swift. However, I think there are a lot of Objective-C developers – many who have come to the language since the iPhone – who don’t use a lot of the features that make Objective-C a powerful, dynamic language.

I started learning Objective-C in 2009 when I learned to write iOS apps. At the time, I didn’t _really_ need to know about the dynamic runtime. Swizzling methods and asking if an object responds to a selector is something I knew about – kind of – but I never really took advantage of those capabilities. And I don’t think my experience is unique.

Why don’t newer Objective-C developers know about these features? I think there are two reasons:

1. A lot of the knowledge needed to use Objective-C’s full dynamic power is woefully under-documented, arcane, and explained only on dated mailing lists.
2. Apple made a decision to de-emphasize Objective-C dynamic nature when building tools for iOS developers (in contrast with tools for OS X developers that already existed).

The second point is far more interesting. Let’s take a look at one example: OS X has this really cool feature in Interface Builder called _bindings_. You can have a property of a view be _bound_ to a property of something else, like `NSUserDefaults`, another view property, a property of an object you’ve added to your nib, whatever. It’s all built atop Objective-C’s dynamic runtime, key-value observation, and value transformers.

When I tell iOS developers about bindings, they’re usually stunned. They have _no idea_ what I’m talking about, because bindings don’t exist on iOS. Whether intentional or not, Interface Builder excluded bindings for iOS interfaces. It’s a tool that’s just not given to iOS developers.

This is one example of a trend: Objective-C has become stricter and stricter. For example: there are compiler warnings for invoking unknown selector names; collections now support generics to restrict the type they contain; initializers now return `instancetype` instead of `id`. These are all small changes, but there are many of them. And their sum effect is a direction from Apple to move the language away from dynamic use.

I can’t fault iOS developers for not knowing how powerful dynamic Objective-C is, because developer tools have been discouraging its use for years.

I admire Brent Simmons, and Craig Hockenberry, and Aaron Hillegass, and many more Objective-C experts. The perspective they bring to Swift is invaluable. [Being reminded of our dependencies](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/09/18/Cocoa-Architecture-Dependencies/) is important. At the same time, though, maybe it’s not important to re-invent Objective-C’s dynamic runtime in Swift. The language is _far_ more static than Objective-C. And besides, a dynamic runtime is only a set of tools used to solve problems. In a different context, like Swift, different tools might be better suited.

We don’t need Objective-C to be pilloried, and we don’t need to pretend that Swift is a superior language in every way. At the end of the day, our job is to build software. Having a diverse set of tools means you can solve a diverse set of problems. Let’s keep sharing what we learn, and let’s keep learning from each other.
