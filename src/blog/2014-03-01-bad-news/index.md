I heard the news recently that my grandmother is sick in the hospital, and the news isn't good. It's got me thinking a lot. My paternal grandmother passed away when I was a kid. It was hard on me.

I've been thinking about growing up with my grandmothers and how important a role that they both played in my life. They inspired my love of literature, the importance I place on social justice, and my scientific intrigue. I can honestly say I wouldn't be the person I am today without their guiding help.

The prospect of losing my grandmother is terrifying to me, especially as I'm so far away from home. I still remember the last time we spoke on the telephone. Everything is happening so fast.

I'm hoping for the best, but I don't know how to prepare for the worst.
