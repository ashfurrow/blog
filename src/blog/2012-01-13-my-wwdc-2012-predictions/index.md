title: My WWDC 2012 Predictions

WWDC 2012 is coming up and I thought I'd compile a list of what I think Apple is going to showcase in their keynote.&nbsp;

I expect a new Xcode 4 project format that allows for easy merging when working with source control systems.

And also an apology for why it's taken Apple so goddamn long to come up with.
