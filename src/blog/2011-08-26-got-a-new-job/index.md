title: Got a New Job

I've been unhappy at my job for a while, despite some great coworkers. The problems &nbsp;really boil down to unmet expectations - I wasn't doing much active development. Even though I pushed for a more active role on the team, I felt unfulfilled and decided to look for a new job. I gave notice Tuesday and was told I could go home right away.

My new job starts Monday. This is a small startup where openness is part of their culture. For instance, they have a blog and are very much in contact with their users. Awesome! I got to meet the cofounders and some of the employees before I signed and I think it's going to be a way better fit for me.

I'm going to be doing work that fulfills me and that exercises my expertise. I'm somewhat specialized in iOS and mobile user interfaces, so I did turn down a few job offers while I was looking. There was no point leaving where I was to join a team doing something other than what I really want to do. In the end, I found what looks like a perfect job. Specialization meant that I had to wait a few more weeks, but in the end, it was worth it.

In the end, patience paid off. I'm very excited to start my new job Monday!
