title: "'Open Your Objective-C' Day"

Recently, CoffeeScript bumpbed Objective-C off the [top-ten list of languages](http://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2014/05/02/github-language-trends-and-the-fragmenting-landscape/) used on GitHub. What a shame. Let's use this as an opportunity to show the rest of the developer community that Objective-C developers care about open source, too.

On Saturday, June 29th, open an Objective-C repository or fork an existing one. Maybe publish some snippets to GitHub gists. Finished or in-progress, doesn't matter. All that matters is releasing code and having fun.

Check out the [EventBrite](http://openobjectivec.eventbrite.com) page for a reminder.
