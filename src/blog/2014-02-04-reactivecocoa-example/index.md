The Big Nerd Ranch blog has a [great post](http://blog.bignerdranch.com/4549-data-driven-ios-development-reactivecocoa/) detailing an example of how to use ReactiveCocoa in a non-trivial way (that is, real-world use). They do so by using a project to explain the motivation behind ReactiveCocoa. Really great stuff.

(Full disclosure: I helped them proof the article.)
