I was honoured to be asked to be a guest on the [iPhreaks podcast episode 52](http://iphreaksshow.com/052-iphreaks-show-book-club-functional-reactive-programming-with-ash-furrow/). In the episode, we discuss ReactiveCocoa, functional reactive programming, and MVVM. It's really an extension of the book itself, taking the topics further than I did in the book. What's really cool is the conversation I got to have with the panelists – answering their questions about ReactiveCocoa. Let me know what you think.
