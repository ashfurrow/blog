Steve Streza has a [follow up post](http://informalprotocol.com/2014/02/replacing-cocoa/) to my post [yesterday](/blog/we-need-to-replace-objective-c) about replacing Objective-C. It's a great read and goes into a lot of depth about what we should look for in a replacement.

> In the years that have followed, the demands of modern Internet apps have exploded, and we are back at a stage of competitive complexity. A new developer platform could once again level the playing field and inspire a new generation of developers to aim high.

Inspiring.
