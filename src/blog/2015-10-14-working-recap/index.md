I recently returned from a two-week long trip to Europe. I spoke at three conferences and a meetup, and I gave a six-hour lab on [reactive programming](https://github.com/ashfurrow/pragma-2015-rx-workshop). I was also maintaining regular contact with work to address some critical issues related to an upcoming deadline, even though I promised them (and myself) that I would be focusing on the trip. 

Three countries, three talks, one workshop, seven take-offs and landings – these all add up to one unavoidable outcome:

I am exhausted.

This is actually quite a revelation to me; let me explain. For months – over a year, actually – I have _felt_ exhausted. But I knew that it was the depression. Therapy and adjustments to my medication have helped alleviate the dampening and other symptoms of depression. During most of my trip, I _felt normal_. No foreboding dread, no sense of impending doom, no anhedonia. 

I had ups and downs, sure, but they were all related to things that were going on at the time. I felt stressed when I was under pressure, not all the time. Most of the time, I felt great.

But I still felt exhausted, and I am now forced to come to the obvious conclusion that I work too much. 

This isn't out of character for me – I've worked too hard most of my life – but I see the toll that it's taken on my friendships, on my marriage, and on my health. And I need to do something about it.

It's time for me to shift away from external obligations, at least for a time. For the next six months, I'll be declining new obligations (conference talks and stuff). My time will be spent focusing on my work at Artsy and the [Peer Lab](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/10/peer-lab/) I run on Saturdays. I'll be spending my free time with my wife and friends. When I feel like it, I'll do some writing and open source contributions, but for now I need to focus on rebalancing my life. 

This means [my upcoming book](https://leanpub.com/swift_book) will be delayed, and that sucks. But I'm trying to not feel guilty about it, because there are more important things than writing software. 

The rest can wait, I need some time for me.
