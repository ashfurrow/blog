[Springboard](http://springboardshow.com), the podcast I [launched](/blog/springboard) only nine days ago, is already a success. I've bene overwhelemed by the response from the Internet. Thanks to everyone who's gotten in touch.

The show is a success in the one dimension that I care about: it's being listened to. The show's site receives over three hundred visitors a day. In contrast, it took years of blogging before my own site ever approached that figure.

I've recorded a number of episodes now, and it's been remarkable to meet with really interesting people and get them to share their stories with listeners. Absolutely fantastic.

If you've enjoyed the show, please consider [rating it on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/springboard/id627783621?mt=2), which would help new listeners find it.

I'm really excited about where this is going.
