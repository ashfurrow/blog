I re-ordered the links at the top of my site today.

I'd like to be able to tell you this action was inspire out of a shift in the purpose of my site; that since I'm incredibly happy at my new job and I want people to be more interested in my writings than myself that I changed this blog to be a blog rather than a job recruiting tool.

But the sad fact is that the latest Wordpress update broke the hack they themselves recommend to have a static page _other_&nbsp;than your blog for the landing page.

My friend Jason [tweeted](http://twitter.com/#!/jasonbrennan/status/116975447526473728) (I can only assume this was directed at me) a link. [ShouldIUseWordpress.com](http://shouldiusewordpress.com/).&nbsp;I really have to learn Ruby on Rails.
