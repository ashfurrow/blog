title: Better, Not Perfect

The Agile Bits blog posted this [fantastic article](http://blog.agilebits.com/2011/06/21/toward-better-master-passwords/) describing how to choose a better password. It's a great read, detailing the motivations behind their advice. They also point out how breaking some rules ( [yeah!](/blog/breaking-the-rules/)) can lead to a more secure online setup.

I have been using [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) all year and have been delighted by it. Last weekend, as part of my effort to [stabilize our chaotic online lives](/blog/taking-control-of-our-digital-lives), I set my wife up with 1Password, and she's really liking it. You should use it, too.

This is also a great example of "good enough" implementations (a common theme on my blog this week, it seems). Sometimes our strive to be perfect is counterproductive in our goal of accomplishing some task.
