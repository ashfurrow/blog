title: Google Ends Exchange Access to GMail

Earlier this year, I made the switch away from [GMail to FastMail](/blog/switching-from-gmail-to-fastmail), a pay service for email. My objection at the time was regarging control of my data and I noticed how GMail had never let me down in the past.

Well, that's changed. Google is [cutting off access to their Exchange servers for non-paid email accounts](http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2012/12/winter-cleaning.html). Exchange is the only way to receive push notifications on iOS from GMail using the built-in Mail.app. iOS users who want to receive push notifications from GMail will be relegated to using the GMail app.

Not only is their communication about this change _pretty vague_, but they're giving everyone a whopping 6 weeks notice.

This makes me nervous.

If you're interested in switching to a paid email provider, I can't recommend [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.fm/?STKI=7977317) enough.
