Anton Bukov has done a great job [replicating the LINQ framework in the Foundation](https://github.com/k06a/NSEnumeratorLinq) collections classes.

For those of you who aren't former .Net fanboys, LINQ is the gem of .Net development. LINQ stands for Language-Integrated Query and it is a compile time, source-independent querying language for .Net. You can query in-memory arrays, SQL databases, or Amazon's API with the same compile-checked querying language. It's awesome.

I actually miss it and, even though blocks made a lot of headway in Objective-C since 2010, the Foundation collections classes still lag behind .Nets in querying. I'm really glad to see progress being made on this.
