title: Full Screen Mode

So I recently [left my job](/blog/moving-on) earlier this month, which means that I also left my maxed out MacBook Pro and 27" Cinema display. I've been working, and writing a book, on my 13" MacBook Air.

Huh.

It's a little smaller and less capable. Frankly, I thought I would miss having "serious" hardware a lot more than I have. However, the little machine has performed admirably.

One thing I have noticed, however, is that I'm using Full Screen mode with more apps lately.

This week, I'll go back to having a "real" computer â€“ an iMac with a Magic Mouse. I'm really curious to see how my habits change. Will I move back to having a bunch of scattered windows overlapping one another on my desktop, or will I keep playing windows on virtual desktops of their own, arranged at the top of that screenshot.

I'm not sure, but I'm going to reflect on what habits form naturally. I'll see what works for me. At any rate, changing machines has given me pause to contemplate serious workflows.
