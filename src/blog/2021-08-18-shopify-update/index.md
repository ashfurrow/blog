It's been over seven months since [I joined Shopify](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/joining-shopify/) and I am overdue on a blog post about my experiences so far. I want to give a little update on my time here: a Shopify Update or, "Shopifupdate", if you will. The tl;dr is that things are going very well! If you're interested in more detail, read on. 

Things at Shopify have been going well for me. I said in my original post that I wanted to work with good people, on interesting technologies, in a high-trust work environment. And Shopify has definitely checked all those boxes. 

Beyond those criteria, the team I'm working on in particular (the [Shop](https://shop.app/) team) has a really great culture that I've found myself feeling at home in. I was surprised by how quickly I felt at ease, actually. As one small example, I know that the word "Shopifupdate" in the opening paragraph of this post is going to get a few laughs in Shop because _these are my kind of people_. Everyone in Shop (and Shopify, broadly) have been generous with their time which has helped me quickly gain the context I need to "do software leadership" within Shopify.

[It's hard to overstate the anxiety I felt leaving Artsy](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/specializing-in-being-a-generalist/) because I was also leaving seven years of context. I knew where to find the answers to all my questions â€“ technical and otherwise. Joining a new team meant losing that context.

But I've built up enough context that I'm able to do my job effectively. I don't know where to find all the answers, but I know where to start looking. It turns out that having context is only part of "doing software leadership" â€“ I've benefited from my experience and intuition, too. I'm leading a team again, we're building a cool project, it's great!

I wrote back in February that:

> I want to use my difficult experience to help other engineers avoid some of my pitfalls and find the joy in React Native. My new job wonâ€™t just be helping Shopify make the most out of a technology; I will be helping to create an environment where engineers feel supported and empowered to do their best work.

My efforts here have been going well. I've already [published one blog post](https://shopify.engineering/react-native-perspectives) for Shopify, with more on the way. I've helped someone build â€“ [and then open source](https://github.com/Shopify/task-list-checker) â€“ an idea they had (blog post forthcoming). All the blog posts I'm working on are co-authored with others; just like at Artsy, I'm helping developers share their experiences with the wider world. It is incredibly satisfying.

By my own metrics, I am succeeding at Shopify. By Shopify's metrics... I am also succeeding ðŸ˜Š And I'm succeeding at Shopify with the same attitude I took to my job at Artsy: being kind and compassionate, learning, sharing what I know, and amplifying the impact of those around me.

Beyond just "succeeding", though, I'm happy. I feel myself _beginning_ to thrive here, and there's still a lot of room for me to grow.
