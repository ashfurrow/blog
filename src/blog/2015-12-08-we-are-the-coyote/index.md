I saw [this](https://twitter.com/andrey_butov/status/674237455911006209) tweeted earlier, and it really resonated with me.

It's been [bouncing around the Internet](http://mentalfloss.com/article/62035/chuck-jones-rules-writing-road-runner-cartoons) for some time now, but I only saw it today. It's quite interesting – let's break it down a bit.

The really interesting part, I think, is the coyote's chase of the Road Runner
as a metaphor for our own pursuit of happiness. The Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote are one-in-the-same, their constant struggle represents the struggle we have on a day-to-day basis to be happy.

Think about it: consider the coyote as the part of yourself that is always chasing "happiness." Now think about the following rules:

"No outside force can harm the coyote – only his own ineptitude..."

"The coyote could stop any time..."

"The coyote is always more humiliated than harmed by his failures."

We all struggle to be happy, but [pursuit of happiness itself will always be fruitless](/blog/you-never-arrive/). The coyote _could_ stop chasing the Road Runner, but it's all he's ever known. But unlike the coyote, _we do_ have a choice. We can stop, and we can realize that [most of our pain is self-inflicted](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/susan-bernstein/dont-shoot-the-second-arr_b_5102701.html). We have a choice the coyote does not, and it would be a shame not to take the wiser path – to stop _chasing_ happiness and maybe you'll actually catch it.
