title: Google Chrome Extension Won't Install?

If you try to install a Google Chrome Extension that you already have installed, but is disabled, it will ask you if you're sure you want to install it. Then it will just sit there with not notification that installation failed or that you already have that extension. Ideally it would ask if you want to re-enable it. For such a well thought-out browser, I would have hoped they'd thought of this.
